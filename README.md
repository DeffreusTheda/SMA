# SMA

Pradita Dirgantara High School, is an international high school located in Komplek Bandara Adi Soemarmo Solo, Jl. Cendrawasih No.4, Tanjungsari, Ngesrep, Kec. Ngemplak, Kabupaten Boyolali, Jawa Tengah (57375).

I personally applied for this school *just* because one of my friend invite me. I literally register myself at the last day of the registration period. I was just getting through the tests, waiting this all to end, but then before I know it, I'm accepted as a new student here. Alas, the same can't be said to the friend that invited me in the first place. My parent was way more happy than I was, and that's enough for me.
