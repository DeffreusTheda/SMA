## ðŸ“–ãƒ»Preambule

<!-- If you're reading this, Heya!

I personally applied for this school *just* because one of my friend invite me.
I literally register myself at the last day of the registration period.
I was just getting through the tests, waiting this all to end, but then before I know it, the announcement day is here.
I vividly remember flipping 3 coins to predict the result, with head for fail and tail for accepted.
I got 3 tails, and the coin didn't lie that day.
Alas, the same can't be said to the friend that invited me in the first place.
Any how, my parent was way more happy than I was, and that's enough for me.

During my time studying here, I've been taking notes on various subjects and accumulated a vault of notes.
I used git to mirror this vault from my macOS partition to manage it from my Asahi Linux, my main OS 'till this day.
I decided to make this public so that the juniors (adeck kelas~) are able to access materials earlier.<br>
That said, have fun studying and take care! :D

## âœ¨ãƒ»Subjects

These are my subjects choices and the status of each subject's notes vault:

1. :indonesia:ãƒ»Indonesian SL (Amateur analysis)
2. :us:ãƒ»English B HL (I suck here)
3. :money_with_wings:ãƒ»**Business Management** SL (Highly extensive collection of notes)
4. :penguin:ãƒ»**Computer Science HL** (See my other repos for ComSci projects and codes!)
5. :computer:ãƒ»Math AI HL (Scarce; I do calc. on GDC or `python3` CLI, both are volatile)
6. :bar_chart:ãƒ»**Physics SL** (Extensive formulas compilation!)

In addition, only-in-IB and national-curriculum subjects have little notes.<br>
**Subjects not mentioned only have little to no notes**. Sorry :'(
