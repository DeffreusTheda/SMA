## ðŸ“–ãƒ»Preambule

<!-- If you're reading this, Heya!

I personally applied for this school *just* because one of my friend invite me. I literally register myself at the last day of the registration period. I was just getting through the tests, waiting this all to end, but then before I know it, I'm accepted as a new student here. Alas, the same can't be said to the friend that invited me in the first place. My parent was way more happy than I was, and that's enough for me.

-->

During my time studying here, I've been taking notes on various subjects and accumulated a vault of notes.
I've been using git to mirror this vault and manage it from both of my Asahi Linux and macOS partition.
I decided to make this public so that the juniors (adeck kelas!) are able to get ahead in class.<br>
Have fun studying and take care! :D

## âœ¨ãƒ»Subjects

These are my subjects choices and the status of each subject's notes vault:

1. :indonesia:ãƒ»Indonesian SL (Amateur analysis)
2. :us:ãƒ»English B HL (I suck here)
3. :money_with_wings:ãƒ»**Business Management** SL (Highly extensive collection of notes)
4. :penguin:ãƒ»**Computer Science HL** (See my other repos for ComSci projects and codes!)
5. :computer:ãƒ»Math AI HL (Scarce; I do calc. on GDC or `python3` CLI, both are volatile)
6. :bar_chart:ãƒ»**Physics SL** (Extensive formulas compilation!)

In addition, only-in-IB and national-curriculum subjects have little notes.<br>
**Subjects not mentioned only have little to no notes**. Sorry :'(
