# PMR

Trying out something ain't in your comfort zone may uh, give memorable experiences, at least that what they said.<br>
Not wrong, but being the only boy in a full girl organization, it's definitely not in the definition of comfort zone for any introvert.<br>
I feel like they're just being nice just for the sake of not offending anyone, or obviously I'm just doubtful of girl.<br>
For any PMR or ex-PMR reading this, I apologize if I ever made any mistake to you, y'all have a kind heart and I thank you for it!
