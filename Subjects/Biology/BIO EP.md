1. Are all living things made of cells? Yes, all living things are made up of cells
	1. Yes, all of them; virus is parasite, sometimes active or not, they're not a living things
2. Do cells share the same structure? No, depends on the type of the organs that the cells makes
	1. They have different structure and functions, but they're the 
	2. Differ unicellular and multicellular; prokaryotic and eli
3. How does 'differentiation' lead to differences in structure?  Differentiation dramatically changes a cell's size, shape, membrane potential, metabolic activity, and responsiveness to signals. These changes are largely due to highly controlled modifications in gene expression and are the study of epigenetics.
	1. How can they (cells) be so smart to differentiate? DNA, more specifically the genes; Nucleus store DNA/RNA; not all DNA is genes; genes instruct what cells gonna be; expressed or repressed, genes can be activated or not which specify the type of genes; THE GENES EXPRESSION
4. What are the main processes of life which happen in cells?  The basics processes include organization, metabolism, responsiveness, movements, reproduction, growth, differentiation, respiration, digestion, and excretion
5. What sort of new properties appear when many cells live collaboratively in multicellular organisms? They became tissue
6. What are the special properties of stem cells?  Perpetual self-renewal and the ability to differentiate into a specialized adult cell type
7. How can we use this knowledge of cells, to exploit stem cells for medical treatments? With stem cell transplant to replace damaged cells

	- Protista/Algae; the thing that makes pool have green colors
	- Paramecium is like animal, have moving body part; it's shape is like sandal, they say
	- Chlorella; the dots is chlorophyll
- What're the main processes of life which happen in cells?
	- "Metabolism" - Mitchell -

Molecules to metabolism -> (molecular biology; important for living organism)
- Bioprocess
	- metabolism is all chemical reaction in living things
	- all chemical reactions have role to break down (**catabolism: identical with hydrolysis; breaking down using water**) and assemble (**anabolism: identical with condensation**) which both process is helped by **enzyme (as catalyst: to speed up reactions**) -- glucose and carbo into energy from many reactions - lipids is more long term source of energy -- 
	- difference of condensation and hydrolysis?
		- **hydrolysis is about breaking down links by adding water (H2O), whereas condensation is bonding/combining of links to make molecules by removing water (H2O)**
	- cell have nucleus and nucleolus (produce ribosomes: create proteins from DNA by replication, translation, asam amino di apain, etc.; helped by the enzyme)
- atom (smallest particle; can differ; Atoms is smaller than molecules) < element (made from one type of atoms) < molecules (made from multiple types of atoms; H2O = hydrogen and oxygen) < compound (made of many molecules)
- what have you know of molecular biology?
	- there's: protein, lipids, carbohydrate, nucleic acid, water (water included in molecular biology, except carbon compounds)
- carbon compound:
	- Protein: CHON
	- Fatty acid: CH3(CH2)nCOOH
	- Carbohydrate: Cn(H2O)n
	- Nucleic acid: CHONP
- carbon can bond indefinitely, one of the characteristics of organic things is that it have carbon
- molecules is more about knowing the structures
- protein always have NH2 and COOH; R group (alanine, arginine, leucine) could be on top, below, right, or left of the reaction
- cis (like the letter U) and trans (like road turning left then right) fatty acid (image):

### Materials
- Metabolism
	- Catabolism (Protein; Peptide bond (C-N)) -> Hydrolysis (Lipid; Ester bond (C-O-C))
	- Anabolism (Protein; Peptide bond (C-N)) -> Condensation (Lipid; combine two; Ester bond (C-O-C); Glycosidic bond (The link between element have a circle in the middle of the link))
- Monosaccharide
	- Glucose
	- Fructose
	- Ribose
- How the scientific evidence for health risks of trans-fat and saturated fats?
	- Saturated fats and *trans* fats raise blood cholesterol levels, while (cis) unsaturated fats lower blood cholesterol levels.
	  
	  LDL (bad, increase cholesterol) is low-density lipoprotein = cair
	  HDL (good, decrease cholesterol) is high-density lipoprotein = beku
	  
	  lemak jenuh itu beku (punya ikatan 2; kalau 1 itu tidak jenuh); 
	  tidak jenuh (unsaturated) itu cair karena ikatannya longgar di suhu ruang (contohnya olive oil, salmon, umumnya berasal dari tumbuhan)
	  
	  isomer adalah molekul yang sama tapi strukturnya berbeda
	  
	  selama ini makanan kita lebih banyak LDL: roti, pisang, sayuran hijau, beras merah, gandum, kedelai, kacang2an, ikan salmon, alpukat
	  untuk HDL: telur, buah serat tinggi, ikan berlemak (tergantung pengolahan), kedelai[nV]
- How the extreme pH and heat influence protein?

- Galactose is
### Data based question: Emperor Penguins
#### a) Calculate the total mass loss for each group of birds.
- [x] i) wild
	(17.3 + 11.8 + 7.7 + 0.4) - (14.4 + 2.2 + 6.9 + 0.4) = 13.3 Kg
- [x] ii) captive
		(18.2 + 12 + 8 + 0.4) - (14.3 + 0.8 + 6.8 + 0.5) = 16.2 Kg
#### b) Compare the changes in lipid content of the captive birds with those of the birds living free in the colony.
- [x] the changes in lipids for the captive birds is more than those birds living free in the colony
- "because they don't cuddle up in dense crowd, making it less warm thus more lipids are gone"
#### c) Besides being used as an energy source, state another function of lipid which might be important for penguin survival.
lipids can be used to store energy ("long term"; in fat molecules; high dense ratio in energy:size), and that energy could be used when there's no input of energy from outer sources like foods
"glucose can also store energy, but it's much quicker process and for short-term"
### Data based question: Nomograms and BMI
#### 1 a) State the body mass index of a man who has a mass of 75 kg and a height of 1.45 metres.
75 Kg divided by 1.45 metre squared = 35.67181926
#### b) Deduce the body mass status of this man.
this man is considered *obese* by the BMI
#### 2 a) State the body mass of the person standing on the scales on the previous page.
the body mass of the person standing on the scales on the previous page is 100 kg
#### b) The person has a height of 1.8 metres. Deduce their body mass status.
100 kg divided by 1.8 metres squared = 30.86419753; he's *obese* :D
#### 3) A woman has a height of 150 cm and a BMI of 40. Calculate the minimum amount of body mass she must lose to reach normal body mass status. Show all of your working.
normal BMI status is 18.5 - 25.0
this woman's weight is 40 multiplied by 1.5 squared = 90 kg
for a woman of the height 150 cm, the most body mass one can have and still be considered as normal body mass status is 25 * 1.5 [squared] = 51.75 kg
90 kg - 51.75 kg = **38.25 kg**
#### b) Suggest two ways in which the woman could reduce her body mass.
do more exercises (to burn calories) and diets (to reduce the gains of calories)
#### 4) Outline the relationship between height and BMI for a fixed body mass.
when the value of height increases, the BMI scales inversely proportional by the power of 2
the opposite apply if the value of height decrease

**Understanding:**

•  Carbon atoms can form four covalent bonds allowing a diversity of stable compounds to exist

    **Organic Compounds**

An organic compound is a compound that contains carbon and is found in _living things_

- Exceptions include carbides (e.g. CaC2), carbonates (CO32–), oxides of carbon (CO, CO2) and cyanides (CN–)  

  

**Carbon** 

Carbon forms the basis of organic life due to its ability to form large and complex molecules via covalent bonding

Carbon atoms can form _four_ covalent bonds, with bonds between carbon atoms being particularly stable (catenation) 

- These properties allows carbon to form a wide variety of organic compounds that are chemically stable

  

**Schematic of a Carbon Atom**

![carbon](https://ib.bioninja.com.au/_Media/carbon_med.jpeg)

  
  

![ninja icon](https://ib.bioninja.com.au/_Media/ninja-icon_med.png)

**Understanding:**

•  Life is based on carbon compounds including carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids

**Main Classes of Carbon Compounds**

There are four principle groups of organic compounds that contribute to much of the structure and function of a cell  
  
**Carbohydrates**  

- Most abundant organic compound found in nature, composed primarily of C,H and O atoms in a common ratio – (CH2O)n
- Principally function as a source of energy (and as a short-term energy storage option)
- Also important as a recognition molecule (e.g. glycoproteins) and as a structural component (part of DNA / RNA)

  
**Lipids**

- Non-polar, hydrophobic molecules which may come in a variety of forms (simple, complex or derived)
- Lipids serve as a major component of cell membranes (phospholipids and cholesterol)
- They may be utilised as a long-term energy storage molecule (fats and oils)
- Also may function as a signalling molecule (steroids)

  
**Nucleic Acids**

- Genetic material of all cells and determines the inherited features of an organism
- DNA functions as a master code for protein assembly, while RNA plays an active role in the manufacturing of proteins

  
**Proteins**

- Make over 50% of the dry weight of cells; are composed of C, H, O and N atoms (some may include S) 
- Major regulatory molecules involved in catalysis (all enzymes are proteins)
- May also function as structural molecules or play a role in cellular signalling (transduction pathways)

**Understanding:**

•  Metabolism is the web of all the enzyme-catalysed reactions in a cell or organism

    Metabolism describes the totality of chemical processes that occur within a living organism in order to maintain life

- It is the web of all enzyme-catalysed reactions that occur within a cell or organism

  
Metabolic reactions serve two key functions: 

- They provide a source of energy for cellular processes (growth, reproduction, etc.) 
- They enable the synthesis and assimilation of new materials for use within the cell

**Understanding:**

•  Anabolism is the synthesis of complex molecules from simpler molecules including the formation of 

   macromolecules from monomers by condensation reactions

Anabolic reactions describe the set of metabolic reactions that build up complex molecules from simpler ones

The synthesis of organic molecules via anabolism typically occurs via condensation reactions

Condensation reactions occur when monomers are covalently joined and water is produced as a by-product

- Monosaccharides are joined via _glycosidic linkages_ to form disaccharides and polysaccharides
- Amino acids are joined via _peptide bonds_ to make polypeptide chains 
- Glycerol and fatty acids are joined via an _ester linkage_ to create triglycerides
- Nucleotides are joined by _phosphodiester bonds_ to form polynucleotide chains

![ninja icon](https://ib.bioninja.com.au/_Media/ninja-icon_med.png)

**Understanding:**

•  Catabolism is the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler molecules including the hydrolysis of 

   macromolecules into monomers

Catabolic reactions describe the set of metabolic reactions that break complex molecules down into simpler molecules

The breakdown of organic molecules via catabolism typically occurs via hydrolysis reactions

Hydrolysis reactions require the consumption of water molecules to break the bonds within the polymer

## MEIOSIS

![big ninja](https://ib.bioninja.com.au/_Media/big-ninja_med.png)

  
**Essential Idea:**  
  
_Alleles segregate during meiosis allowing new  
_  
_combinations to be formed by the fusion of gametes_

       
**Understandings:**

- One diploid nucleus divides by meiosis to produce four haploid nuclei
- Separation of pairs of homologous chromosomes in the first division of meiosis halves the chromosome number
- DNA is replicated before meiosis so that all chromosomes consist of two sister chromatids
- The early stages of meiosis involve pairing of homologous chromosomes and crossing over followed by condensation
- Orientation of pairs of homologous chromosomes prior to separation is random
- The halving of the chromosome number allows a sexual life cycle with fusion of gametes
- Crossing over and random orientation promotes genetic variation
- Fusion of gametes from different parents promotes genetic variation

  

**Applications:**

- Non-disjunction can cause Down syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities
- Studies showing age of parents influences chances of non-disjunction
- Description of methods used to obtain cells for karyotype analysis – e.g. chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis and the associated risks

  

**Skills:**

- Drawing diagrams to show the stages of meiosis resulting in the formation of four haploid cells

**Understandings:**

•  One diploid nucleus divides by meiosis to produce four haploid nuclei

•  Separation of pairs of homologous chromosomes in the first meiotic division halve the chromosome number  

    Meiosis is the process by which sex cells (gametes) are made in the reproductive organs

- It involves the reduction division of a diploid germline cell into four genetically distinct haploid nuclei

  
The process of meiosis consists of two cellular divisions:

- The first meiotic division separates pairs of homologous chromosomes to halve the chromosome number (diploid **→** haploid)
- The second meiotic division separates sister chromatids (created by the replication of DNA during interphase)

![ninja icon](https://ib.bioninja.com.au/_Media/ninja-icon_med.png)

**Understanding:**

•  DNA is replicated before meiosis so that all chromosomes consist of two sister chromatids

    Meiosis is preceded by interphase, during which DNA is replicated (in the S phase) to produce two genetically identical copies

- The two identical DNA molecules are identified as _sister chromatids_, and are held together by a single centromere
- The sister chromatids are separated during meiosis II, following the separation of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I

•  Drawing diagrams to show the stages of meiosis resulting in the formation of four haploid cells

Meiosis consists of two divisions, both of which follow the same stages as mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase)

- Meiosis is preceded by _interphase_, in which DNA is replicated to produce chromosomes consisting of two sister chromatids
- A second growth phase called _interkinesis_ may occur between meiosis I and II, however no DNA replication occurs in this stage

  
**Meiosis I**

The first meiotic division is a reduction division (diploid **→** haploid) in which homologous chromosomes are separated 

- **P-I:** Chromosomes condense, nuclear membrane dissolves, homologous chromosomes form bivalents, crossing over occurs
- **M-I:** Spindle fibres from opposing centrosomes connect to bivalents (at centromeres) and align them along the middle of the cell
- **A-I:** Spindle fibres contract and split the bivalent, homologous chromosomes move to opposite poles of the cell
- **T-I:** Chromosomes decondense, nuclear membrane _may_ reform, cell divides (cytokinesis) to form two haploid daughter cells

  
**Meiosis II**

The second division separates sister chromatids (these chromatids may not be identical due to crossing over in prophase I) 

- **P-II:** Chromosomes condense, nuclear membrane dissolves, centrosomes move to opposite poles (perpendicular to before)
- **M-II:** Spindle fibres from opposing centrosomes attach to chromosomes (at centromere) and align them along the cell equator
- **A-II:** Spindle fibres contract and separate the sister chromatids, chromatids (now called chromosomes) move to opposite poles
- **T-II:** Chromosomes decondense, nuclear membrane reforms, cells divide (cytokinesis) to form four haploid daughter cells 

  

The final outcome of meiosis is the production of four haploid daughter cells

- These cells may all be genetically distinct if crossing over occurs in prophase I (causes recombination of sister chromatids)

**Understanding:**

•  The early stages of meiosis involve pairing of homologous chromosomes and crossing over 

followed by condensation

In **prophase I**, homologous chromosomes undergo a process called _synapsis_, whereby they pair up to form a _bivalent_ (or tetrad)

- The homologous chromosomes are held together at points called chiasmata (singular: chiasma)

  

Crossing over of genetic material between non-sister chromatids can occur at these chiasmata

- As a result of this exchange of genetic material, new gene combinations are formed on chromatids (recombination)

  

Once chiasmata are formed, the homologous chromosomes condense as bivalents and then are separated in meiosis

- If crossing over occurs then all four haploid daughter cells will be genetically distinct (sister chromatids are no longer identical)

### Drawing Meiosis

  
Meiosis consists of two divisions and results in the formation of four daughter cells

- Interphase replicates DNA in the S phase, so chromosomes should initially possess sister chromatids ( **|** **→** **X** )
- The first division separates the homologous pairs ( **X X** **→** X , X ) and hence halves the chromosome number
- The second division separates the sister chromatids ( **X** **→** **|** , **|** ) leading to the formation of single chromatid chromosomes
- By the end of the process, the cells should be haploid (have half the number of chromosomes of the original diploid cell)

### Mitosis versus Meiosis

  
Mitosis and meiosis are two processes by which eukaryotic cells may divide and share several similarities:

- They are both preceded by interphase (which includes DNA replication)
- They both divide according to a common pathway (prophase **→** metaphase **→** anaphase **→** telophase)
- They both split their cells via cytokinesis

  

However there are certain key differences which distinguish the two processes:

- **D****ivision** – Mitosis involves only one cell division, but meiosis requires two cell divisions
- **I****ndependent assortment** – Homologous pairs are randomly separated into separate cells in meiosis, but not mitosis
- **S****ynapsis** – Homologous pairs form bivalents in meiosis, but not mitosis
- **C****rossing over** – Non-sister chromatids of homologous pairs may exchange genetic material in meiosis, but not mitosis
- **O****utcome** – Mitosis results in the formation of two daughter cells, while meiosis produces four daughter cells
- **P****loidy** – Daughter cells produced by mitosis are diploid, while daughter cells produced by meiosis are haploid
- **U****se** – Mitosis is used to clone body cells, while meiosis is used to generate sex cells (gametes)
- **G****enetics** – Cells produced by mitosis are genetically identical (clones), while cells produced by meiosis are genetically distinct
