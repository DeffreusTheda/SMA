# Current and Circuit

One battery is called cell, while multiple is called batteries.

## Potential Difference

Shortnamed 'pd', it has the unit of Volt ($V$).

<details>
    <summary>$V = \frac{W}{q}$</summary>
    $V$ = Potential difference ($J$) <br>
    $W$ = Work ($J$) <br>
    $q$ = Energy transferred/converted ($J$)
</details>

Measured from the one end of a unit (resistor|battery|etc.) to the other end.
It may be seen from the loss of Voltage from source (emf, in Volt) to a resistor (pd, in Volt).

## Resistivity

Resistivity ($\ohm m$) is the value of resistance.
High resistivity means that it's inefficient at transfering current.

## Resistance

Resistance (R) $\ohm$ is a measure of the opposition to current flow in an electrical circuit.
Increase in Resistance ($R$) will result in decrease in current clow ($I$).
Whenever a current pass through an object with resistance, some of the current will be gone.
The value of resistance differs among different materials, with glass being the most resistive and silver being the least resistive.

<details>
    <summary>$R ~ l/A$</summary>
    $R$ = Resistance ($\ohm m$) <br>
    $l$ = Length ($m$) <br>
    $A$ = Cross sectional area ($m$)
</details>

<details>
    <summary>$R = P \cdot \frac{l}{A}$</summary>
    $R$ = Resistance ($\ohm m$) <br>
    $P$ = Resistivity ($\ohm m$) <br>
    $l$ = Length ($m$) <br>
    $A$ = Cross sectional area ($m$)
</details>

Cables with the same material may have different resistance if their length and cross sectional area is different.
As length increase, the current that pass through will decrease.
This can happen with increase in temperature, which may increase the length of the cable.
And as the cross sectional area increase, the current that pass through will increase, as in wider traffic road.

## Current 

<details>
    <summary>$I = \frac{E}{(R + r)} = \frac{q}{t}$</summary>
    $I$ = Current ($V$) <br>
    $E$ = Electromotive Force <br>
    $R$ = Outer Resistance ($\ohm m$) <br>
    $r$ = Inner Resistance ($\ohm m$) <br>
    $q$ = Energy transferred ($J$) <br>
    $t$ = temperature ($K$)
</details>

With the Ohm's Law, the formula for Current can also be constructed as:

<details>
    <summary>$I = \frac{V}{R}$</summary>
    $I$ = Current ($V$) <br>
    $V$ = Potential difference ($J$) <br>
    $R$ = Resistance ($\ohm m$)
</details>

## Ohm's Law

The current through an ohmic conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across it provided that the temperature remains constant.

<details>
    <summary>$R = \frac{V}{I}$</summary>
    $R$ = Electrical Resistance ($\ohm m$) <br>
    $V$ = Potential difference ($J$) <br>
    $I$ = Current ($V$)
</details>

When a lamp filament is flowed with electrical current (and heat), the filament will vibrate faster and thus the pressure increase.
In addition, the higher the number of 'free' or 'loose' electron, the resistance will decrease.

Increase in T = increase in V = increase in P = decrease in R = increase in electron count

### Electromotive Force

<details>
    <summary>$emf = I_R + I_r = I \cdot (R + r)$</summary>
    $I_R$ = current in outer resistor. <br>
    $I_r$ = current in inner (inside battery) resistor. <br>
    $I$ = Current ($V$) <br>
    $R$ = Outer Resistance ($\ohm m$) <br>
    $r$ = Inner Resistance ($\ohm m$)
</details>

emf stand for electromotive force, the energy supplied by a battery or a cell per coulomb of charge passing through it.
In battery, chemical energy turns into electrical energy, which can further be converted to heat energy or light.

### Electrical Power

<details>
    <summary>$P = \frac{W}{t}$</summary>
    $P$ = Power delivered (watt, $J s^{-1}$) <br>
    $W$ = Work ($J$) <br>
    $t$ = Time ($s$)
</details>

#### Power Delivered; e.g chemical to electrical energy

$P = \frac{E \cdot q}{t} = E \cdot I$

#### Power Dissipated

$P = \frac{V \cdot q}{t} = V \cdot I$

### Electric Current

Current direction is from negative to the positive.
The electron goes in the direction from positive to the negative.

### Learning Check 4

The resistivity of copper is $1.72 \cdot 10^{-8} \ohm m$. What is the resistance of a $1 m$ length of $2 mm$ diameter copper wire?

- $R ~ l/A$
- $R = \frac{1 m}{2 mm}$
- $R = \frac{1 m}{0.002 m}$
- $R = 500 m$

### Learning Check 5

A cell of emf (electromotive force, with the unit Volt) $9 V$ with an internal resistance $1 \ohm$ is connected to a $2 \ohm$ resistor, as shown in Figure 2.2

![Figure 2.2](~/Documents/Obsidian/Images/Figure 2.2)

How much current will flow?

- $I = \frac{E}{(R + r)}$
- $I = \frac{9 V}{(2 \ohm + 1 \ohm)}$
- $I = \frac{9 V}{(3 \ohm)}$
- $I = 3 V$

### Learning Check 6

- $P = V \cdot I$
- $P = 220 V \cdot 3 A$
- $P = 660 watt$

- $P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{\delta E}{t} = \frac{Q}{t} = \frac{m \cdot c \cdot \delta T}{t}$

### Learning Check 7

An electric motor that is connected to a $12 V$ supply is able to raise a $0.10 kg$ load through a distance of $1.5 m$ in $7 s$. The motor is 40% efficient. Calculate the average current in the motor while the load is being raised.

- $P_t = V \cdot I$ - The total power, not the 40%.
- $P_t = 12 V \cdot I$ - Now let's search for I.

- $P_t = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{F \cdot s}{t}$ - The work is the change in potential energy.
- $P_t = \frac{m \cdot g \cdot h}{t}$
- $P = 40% \cdot (12 V \cdot I) = \frac{m \cdot g \cdot h}{t}$
- $P = \frac{0.10 kg \cdot 10 m s^{-2} \cdot 1.5 m}{7 s}$
- $P = 0.2142857143 watt$

### Learning Check 8

Two $12 V$ cells are connected in series to a $10 \ohm$ resistor. If each cell has an internal resistance of $1 \ohm$, how much current will flow?

- $V = I \cdot R$
- $R = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{12 V + 12 V}{10 \ohm + 1 \ohm + 1 \ohm}$
- $R = \frac{24 V}{12 \ohm} = 2 A$

## Road to Topic Test - Current and Circuit

### 1

The diagram shows a potential divider circuit used to measure the emf *E* of a cell X.
Both cells have negligible internal resistance.

![No. 1 Diagram](/Images/Road_to_Topic_Test_-_Current_and_Circuit.png)

(a) State what is meant by the emf of a cell.

- emf stand for electromotive force, the energy supplied by a battery or a cell per coulomb of charge passing through it. It's stated in the unit of Voltage.

(b) AB is a wire of uniform cross-section and length $1.0 m$. The resistance of wire AB is $80 \ohm$. When the length of AC is $0.35 m$ the current in cell X is zero.

(i) Show that the resistance of the wire AC is $28 \ohm$.

- $R = \frac{l}{A}$
- $80 \ohm = \frac{1.0 m}{A_{AB}}$
- $A_{AB} = \frac{1.0 m}{80 \ohm} = 0.0125 m$
- We also know that the cross-section area of AB and AC is the same, so
- $A_{AB} = A_{AC} = 0.0125 m$
- Thus, we can use
- $R_{AC} = \frac{0.35 m}{0.0125 m} = 28 \ohm$

(ii) Determine E.

- $emf = I \cdot (R + r)$
- But in this case,
- $emf = I \cdot ((R_{AB} + R_{AC}) + 0)$
- Thus,
- $emf = 12 V \cdot ((80 \ohm + 28 \ohm) + 0) = 1296 V$

A photovoltaic cell is supplying energy to an external circuit. The photovoltaic cell can be modelled as a practical electrical cell with internal resistance.

The intensity of solar radiation incident on the photovoltaic cell at a particular time is at a maximum for the place where the cell is positioned.

The following data are available for this particular time:

| Variable | Value |
| ---: | :--- |
| Operating current | $0.90 A$ |
| Output potential difference to external circuit | $14.5 V$ |
| Output emf of photovoltaic cell | $21.0 V$ |
| Area of panel | $350 mm \cdot 450 mm$ |

(a) Explain why the output potential difference to the external circuit and the output emf of photovoltaic cell are different. \[2\]

- Because there is an internal resistance of the photovoltaic cell and load resistance of the external circuit.

(b) Calculate the internal resistance of the photovoltaic cell for the maximum intensity condition using the model for the cell. \[3]

- Assuming there is no other resistance in the circuit other than the internal resistance of the photovoltaic cell, we can use the following formula for calculating the internal resistance of the photovoltaic cell:
- $emf = I_R + I_r $
- $21.0 V = 14.5 V + (0.90 A * r)$
- $r = \frac{21.0 V - 14.5 V}{0.90 A} = 7 \frac{2}{9}$

(c) The maximum intensity of sunlight incident on the photovoltaic cell at the place on the Earth's surface is $680 W m^{-2}$

A measure of the efficiency of a photovoltaic cell is the ratio

$\frac{energy\~available\~every\~second\~to\~the\~external\~circuit}{energy\~arriving\~every\~second\~at\~the\~photovoltaic\~cell\~surface}$.

Determine the efficiency of this photovoltaic cell when the intensity incident upon it is at a maximum. \[3]
