If the natural frequency of wind is the same with the building, then it can be disturbed and start to [oscilate](oscilation).

e.g. a scream that have the same frequency with a glass' natural frequency will break the glass.<br>
e.g. buildings vibrate because of a plane having the same frequency with the building's natural frequency.

This can be countered by using a damping structure on the natural frequency of the building.

Engineer measure the natural frequency of buildings to prevent winds from causing them to vibrate, by using [[driving force]] then seeing the amplitude changes:

## Factors

$$\begin{align*}
T = \frac{1}{f} &= 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}} \\
f &= \frac{1}{2 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{g}{l}} \\
\therefore ~&\text{frequency is only affected by length, excluding gravity (mostly constant)}
\end{align*}$$

## Tacoma Bridge Natural Frequency

The Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940) collapsed on November 7, 1940, due to aeroelastic flutter, not resonance. The bridge’s natural frequency was around 12 cycles per minute (0.2 Hz), which was not matched by the wind frequency. Instead, the sustained, strong wind (approximately 42 mph or 68 km/h) caused vortices to form, leading to a twisting motion that eventually caused the bridge’s collapse.
