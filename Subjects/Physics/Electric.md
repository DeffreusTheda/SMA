Power = Work/t
V = IR
I = V/R = Vq/t = VI = V^2/R

#### Learning Check 1

The current through an LED desk lamp is 50 mA.

- Calculate the amount of charge which flows through the lamp in 1.0 minute.

> $A = C/s$
> $0.05 mA \cdot 60 s = 3 C$

- How many electrons flow through the lamp every minute?

> $1 C = 6.24E018 _{electrons}$
> $3 C \cdot 6.24E018 _{electrons} = 1.872E019 _{electrons}$

#### Learning Check 2

- A high efficiency LED lamp is lit for 2 hours. Calculate the energy transfer to the lamp when the pd across it is 240 V and the current in it is 50 mA.

> $t = 2 h = 7200 s$
> $I = 50 mA$
> $V = 240 V$
> $V = \frac{W}{q}$
> $W = V \cdot q = V \cdot I \cdot t = 240 V \cdot 5E-02 A \cdot 7200 s = 86400 J$

#### Leaning Check 3

A cell has a terminal voltage of 1.5 V and can deliver a charge of 460 C before it becomes discharged.

- Calculate the maximum energy that the cell can deliver.

> $energy = W$
> $t = \frac{C}{V} = \frac{460 C}{1.5 V} = 306.67 s$
> $W = V \cdot I \cdot t = 1.5 V \cdot $

- The current in the cell never exceeds 5 mA. Estimate the lifetime of the cell.
