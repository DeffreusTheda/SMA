Definitions: measurement of mass in motion; how much mass is in how much motion;$^2$
Denoted by the symbol P.
Every moving things have momentum$^1$
External force causes velocity to change (in other words, acceleration) which in turn also change Momentum.

### Formulas:
P = m.v
	m = "mass" // kg
	v = "velocity" // ms$^-$$^1$
