a. $E_{absorbed} = 610 W m^{-2} \cdot (1 - 0.18) = 500.2 W m^{-2}$
b. The midday is the peak of incident power, thus later in the day the incident power will decrease, thus the absorbed energy will decreases too.

#### Learning Check 2

Emissivity = $\frac{1.3 E16 W}{1.4 E14 m^2 \cdot 5.67 E-8 W m^{-2} K^{-4} \cdot (-64 + 257.15)^4 K}$
