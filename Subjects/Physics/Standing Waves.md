Definition: two [[travelling waves]] of equal [[amplitude]] and equal [[frequency]] travelling with the same [[speed]] in opposite directions are superposed ([[superposition]]).

*Because the resultant red [[wave]] is not traveling it is called a standing wave.*

## Characteristics

- [[crests]] stay in the same place, they do not move right or left as they do in the case of [[travelling waves]]  
- Has [[Nodes]] and [[Antinodes]]
- The [[amplitude]] of [[oscillation]] is different at different points on the [[string]]
- A standing wave does not transfer energy: it consists of two [[travelling waves]] that transfer energy in opposite directions 
- The ends of a standing wave are either [[Nodes]] or [[Antinodes]]. These ‘end or boundary conditions’ determine the possible shape of the [[wave]].

## On [[String]] or [[Pipes]]

- One loop, with two nodes and one antinode. This is the standing wave with the longest [[wavelength]] (and the lowest [[frequency]]): it is called the first [[Harmonic]] or fundamental frequency. 
- A harmonic is named by the **ratio of its frequency to that of the first harmonic**
- On closed pipes, the boundary can only be a pair of an antinode and a node

- All harmonics have frequencies that are integral multiples of the fundamental frequency, i.e. of the first harmonic.
- The fundamental frequency is also called first harmonic.

| f=2v/2L |         | f=2v/2L |
| f=3v/2L | f=3v/4L | f=3v/2L |
| f=4v/2L |         | f=4v/2L |

- For stretched strings, the [[boundary]] conditions are that there will be nodes at fixed boundaries and antinodes at free boundaries.
- an closed-end or a fixed boundary; there will be the usual [[phase change]] of 180° at a fixed boundary meaning that the [reflected](Reflection%20(Wave)) wave cancels the [[incident wave]] and so forms a node.
- an open-ended pipe there is still a reflection of the wave at the boundary but no phase change, so the reflected wave does not cancel the incident wave and there is an antinode formed
- The [[molecules]] in the middle of the pipe do not oscillate at all: they are at a node. 
- The dots represent molecules of air in the pipe. 
- The double-headed arrows show how far these molecules oscillate back and forth (the amplitude of the oscillations)
- At the boundary between a denser medium and air: it produces an antinode (due to the 180° phase shift in the reflected wave).
- At the boundary between air and a denser medium: it produces a node (since there is no phase shift in the reflected wave).

## Common Mistakes

- The standing waves on stretched [strings](string) are [transverse](transversal%20wave), but when oscillations are passed on through the air they are [[longitudinal waves]] (for example, the sounds produced by stringed musical instruments)jj.
