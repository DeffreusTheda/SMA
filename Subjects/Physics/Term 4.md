## Newton Law of Gravitation

$F = G \frac{M_1 \cdot M_2}{r^2}$

F is gravitational force
r is distance between to object center to center.
G is a universal gravitational constant ($6.674 \cdot 10^{-11} N m^2 kg^{-2}$)

To apply:
- Point Mass: spherical and of uniform density, one can assume that the entire mass of the body is concentrated at its centre
- Distance is greater than the size of objects

### Learning Check

$F = G \cdot \frac{m^2}{(2 r)^2}$
$F = G \cdot \frac{m^2}{4 r^2}$

$F = G \cdot \frac{m_1 m_2}{4 r^2} + G \cdot \frac{M \cdot m_2}{(2 r)^2}$
$F = \frac{G \cdot m_2}{4 r^2} (m_1 + M)$
Straight to the left.

M/m = 0.75^2 / 0.25^2 = 9.0

## Kepler's Law of Planetary Motion

Not from calculation, instead it's observation of other observations.
Tycho Brahe, he collect data from the solar system, and he only observe, he sees similarity and makes them into 3 rules.

1. **First Law: Elliptical Orbits**<br>
   Every planet moves along an ellipse, with the Sun located at one of the two foci (focus of the ellipse). The semi-major axis (average distance from the Sun) and eccentricity (deviation from a perfect angle; $0 < \frac{c}{a} < 1$) define the shape of the orbit. Major axis is the longest whereas minor axis is the shortest.
2. Line joining a planet and the sun sweeps equal areas in equal times. Perihelion (P; closest point in ellipse) and aphelion (A; farthest point in ellipse), with formula $\frac{1}{2} V_A \cdot t \cdot S_A$. Distance is inversely proportional with displacement. 
3. $T^2$ ~ $r^3$ or $T^2$ = $\frac{4 \pi^2 r^3}{G M}$. Revolution of planet is proportional to the $\frac{2}{3}$ of the semi major axis of the ellipse (average of major axis and minor axis).

$b^2 + c^2 = a^2$

Assume $a = 5$ and $b = 4$, thus $c = 3$

How to find foci:

$$\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$

$$\frac{y^2}{4^2} = \frac{5^2}{5^2} - \frac{3^2}{5^2}$$

$$y^2 = \frac{16}{25} \cdot 16$$

$$y = \frac{16}{5}$$

$$2a = RF_1 + RF_2$$

$$2a = \sqrt{6^2 + \frac{16}{5}} + RF_2$$

## Orbital Motion

To maintain a constant orbit there must be no frictional forces, so the only force on the particle is the force of gravitation. This force provides the centripetal force on the particle, therefore:

$\frac{m v^2}{r} = \frac{G M m}{r^2}$

...

$T^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 r^2}{G M}$

$a = \alpha r$ alpha is angular acceleration
$\omega$ is angular velocity

## Learning Check

1. Why are comets such a rare sight?

Comet's eccentricity is very high, whereas earth's eccentricity is very low.
Thus, the probability of seeing them is low.

	 c. In a servicing mission, a space shuttle spotted the Hubble telescope a distance of 10 km ahead. Estimate how long it took the shuttle to catch up with Hubble, assuming that the shuttle was moving in a circular orbit just 500 m below Hubble orbit.<br>
      $v_s^2 = \frac{6.674 \cdot 10^{-11} \cdot 6.0 \cdot 10^24}{559500}$<br>
			$v_s = 5.35055308 \cdot 10^{-7} = 5.4 \cdot 10^{-7}$<br>
			$v_h - v_s = 2.38917318 \cdot 10^{-10} km s^{-1}$<br>

### Learning Check

**6. The solar system is at a distance of about 27,000 light years from the centre of the Milky Way galaxy. A light year is the distance travelled by light in one year. The solar system orbits the galactic centre in a circular orbit with a speed that is roughly $200 km s^{-1}$.**

**The speed of light is 3.0 x 108 m s- 1. Convert a light year into metres**

$$AU = 3.0 \times 10^8 \cdot 31557600.0 = 9.46728 \times 10^{15} m$$

**How long, in years, does it take the solar system to perform one full revolution?**

$$T = \frac{2 \pi \cdot 27000 AU}{2 \times 10^5} = 8.03043107 \times 10^{15}$$

**The mass of the galaxy that attracts our solar system is the mass of the galaxy that is within the orbit radius of the solar system. Estimate this mass.**

$$T^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2 r^3}{G M}$$

$$M = \frac{4 \pi^2 r^3}{G T^2}$$

$$M = \frac{4 \pi^2 (27000 \cdot 9.46728 \times 10^{15})^3}{6.674 \times 10^{-11} (8.03043107 \times 10^{15})^2} = 1.53201414 \times 10^{41}$$

## Electric field

Most of the notes are in Anki.

### Leaning Check

**13. A proton is placed on the positive plate in a parallel plate arrangement and is then released**

**The potential difference between the plates is $120 V$ and the separation of the plates is $2.0 cm$.**

**a. Calculate the electric field strength in between the plates.**

$$E = \frac{V}{d} = \frac{120}{2 \times 10^{-2}} = 6000$$

**b. Calculate the force on the proton.**

$$F = E q = 6000 \cdot 1.6 \times 10^{-19} = 9.6 \times 10^{-16}$$

**c. Determine the gain in kinetic energy of the proton when it reaches the negative plate.**

$$\delta KE = W = V q = 120 \cdot 1.6 \times 10^{-19} = 1.92 \times 10^{-17}$$

**d. The distance between the plates is doubled but the potential difference remains the same. How do the answers to parts a and b change, if at all?**

Both a and b is halved.
KE is still the same though.

### Test Your Understanding

**1. A charged conducting sphere with charge $$+12 µC$$ is allowed to touch an identical conducting sphere of charge $$-6 µC$$. The spheres are then separated. What is the charge on each sphere after separation?**

$$\frac{12 + (-6)}{2} = 3 µC$$

**2. The electroscope is a device consisting of a metal sphere, a metallic rod connected to the sphere and two light metallic leaves attached to the rod. When charge is deposited on the sphere, rod and leaves, the leaves repel as shown. The whole arrangement (see Figure) is protected within a glass jar. Suppose the charge on the electroscope is positive. A negatively charged rod is put close but not touching the sphere of the electroscope. What will happen to the leaves?**

The leaves will start to close as the proton move from the leaves and rod to the metal sphere due to the attraction in the metal sphere.

**3. An electroscope is neutral. The following process takes place:**
**a. a positively charged rod is placed close but not touching the sphere of the electroscope 
b. the sphere is earthed 
c. the earthing is removed with the charged rod still in place 
d. the rod is removed far away.**

**At each stage draw a diagram to represent the state of the electroscope.**

**4. a. Calculate the force between charges $q_1$ of $2.0 µC$ and $q_2$ of $4.0 µC$ separated by $r = 5.0 cm$.**

$$F = 8.99\times10^{-12} \frac{2.0\times10^{-6} \cdot 4.0\times10^{-6}}{5\times10^{-2}} = 2.8768\times10^{-20} N$$

**4. b. Let the force calculated in a be $F$. In terms of $F$ and without further calculations, state the force between these charges when:**

**i. the separation $r$ of the charges is doubled**

$$\frac{f}{4}$$

**ii. $q_1$ and $r$ are both double**

$$\frac{f}{2}$$

**iii. $q_1$, $q_2$ and $r$ are all doubled**

$$F$$

**5. Three charges are placed on a straight line as shown in Figure below. Calculate the net force on the middle charge.**

![Figure](img/TYU5.png)

$$\Sigma F = -F_1 + F_2$$

$$= - 8.99\times10^{-12} \frac{-2.0\times10^{-6} \cdot 4.0\times10^{-6}}{(4.0\times10^{-2})^2} + 8.99\times10^{-12} \frac{-2.0\times10^{-6} \cdot 3.0\times10^{-6}}{(2.0\times10^{-2})^2}$$

$$= 4.495\times10^{-20} - 1.3485\times10^{-19} = 1.798\times10^{-19}$$

**6. In the previous question (no 5), determine the position of the middle charge so that it is in equilibrium.**

Assuming, only the middle charge move, $r_1 + r_2 = 6.0 cm$

$$\Sigma F = 0 = F_2 - F_1$$

$$F_1 = F_2$$

$$k \frac{-2.0\times10^{-6} \cdot 4.0\times10^{-6}}{r_1^2} = k \frac{-2.0\times10^{-6} \cdot 3.0\times10^{-6}}{r_2^2}$$

$$\frac{4.0\times10^{-6}}{r_1^2} = \frac{3.0\times10^{-6}}{r_2^2} \textrightarrow 4 r_2^2 = 3 r_1^2$$

Using solver,

$$r_1 + r_2 = 6.0 cm, 4 r_2^2 = 3 r_1^2 /textrightarrow r_1 = 3.2 cm, r_2 = 2.8 cm$$

**7. Calculate the force (magnitude and direction) on the charge $q$ in Figure below, where $q = 3.0 µC$.**

<!-- TODO:--->

### The Millikan Oil Drop Experiment

Between 1910 and 1911.

Voltage can be controlled from 0 to whatever.
The oil is dripping down bit by bit.

<!-- TODO:--->

On zero potential difference, you have the formula:

$$F_{drag\~down} = m_{oil} g = \rho_{oil}^2 V_{oil} g = \rho_{oil}^2 \frac{4}{3} \pi r_{oil}^3 g = 6 \pi \eta_{air} r_{oil} v_{oil}$$

$F_{drag\~down}$ is opposite to (falling) movement. $\eta$ is viscosity, $r$ is radius of oil, and $v$ is terminal velocity (it's so small that it reach terminal velocity, that's why you need microscope)

$\sigma F_y = 0$. -> $r_{oil}^2 = \frac{g m v}{2 \rho_oil g}$

$$F = m a = P A = p g h A = p g V$$

- F = Force
- p = density
- g = gravity
- h = height
- A = area
- V = volume

NOW, Oil drops that were charged by X-rays were allowed to enter a region of uniform electric field between the parallel plates.
electron and neutron will be split, so it can go to the oil, and makes it negatively charged;
when the electron is stationary (because of F coulomb), by adjusting V.

$$E q = _{oil} g \textrightarrow q = \frac{m_{oil} g}{E} \textrightarrow q = \frac{m_{oil} g d}{V_{balance}}$$
