## Newton Law of Gravitation

$F = G \frac{M_1 \cdot M_2}{r^2}$

F is gravitational force
r is distance between to object center to center.
G is a universal gravitational constant ($6.67 \cdot 10^{-11} N m^2 kg^{-2}$)

To apply:
- Point Mass: spherical and constant mass of body, with center of mess at its centre
- Distance is greater than the size of objects
