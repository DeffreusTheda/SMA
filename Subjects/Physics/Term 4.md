## Newton Law of Gravitation

$F = G \frac{M_1 \cdot M_2}{r^2}$

F is gravitational force
r is distance between to object center to center.
G is a universal gravitational constant ($6.674 \cdot 10^{-11} N m^2 kg^{-2}$)

To apply:
- Point Mass: spherical and of uniform density, one can assume that the entire mass of the body is concentrated at its centre
- Distance is greater than the size of objects

### Learning Check

$F = G \cdot \frac{m^2}{(2 r)^2}$
$F = G \cdot \frac{m^2}{4 r^2}$

$F = G \cdot \frac{m_1 m_2}{4 r^2} + G \cdot \frac{M \cdot m_2}{(2 r)^2}$
$F = \frac{G \cdot m_2}{4 r^2} (m_1 + M)$
Straight to the left.

M/m = 0.75^2 / 0.25^2 = 9.0

### D1. Test Your Understanding

Unless stated otherwise, take the radius and mass of the earth to be 6.4 x 10 6 m and 6.0 x 10 24 kg, respectively.

1. Calculate the gravitational force between:
   1. The earth and the moon (distance between earth and moon = 3.8 x 10 5 km; moon's mass= 7.3 x 10^{22} kg)<br>
      $F = \frac{G \cdot 6.0 \cdot 10^{24} m \cdot 7.3 \cdot 10^{22} m}{(3.8 \cdot 10^8)^2}$<br>
      $F = 2.02438504 \cdot 10^{20} N$<br>
      $F = 2.0 \cdot 10^{20} N$
   2. A proton and an electron separated by 10 -10 m (mass of proton = 1.67 X 10 - 27 kg; mass of electron = 9.11 x 10 - 31 kg).<br>
      $F = \frac{G \cdot 1.67 \cdot 10^{-27} \cdot 9.11 \cdot 10^{-31}}{(10^{-10})^2}$<br>
      $F = 1.01536234 \cdot 10^{-47} N$<br>
      $F = 1.0 \cdot 10^{-47} N$
2. Stars A and B have the same mass, and the radius of star A is nine times larger than the radius of star B. Calculate the ratio of the gravitational field strength on star A to that on star B.<br>
   $g = \frac{G \cdot M}{r^2}$<br>
   $\frac{\frac{G \cdot M}{(9r)^2}}{\frac{G \cdot M}{r^2}} =$
   $\frac{r^2}{(9r)^2} =$
   $\frac{r^2}{81r^2} =$
   $\frac{1}{81}$
3. Planet A has a mass that is twice as large as the mass of planet B and a radius that is twice as large as the radius of planet B. Calculate the ratio of the gravitational field strength on planet A to that on planet B.<br>
   $\frac{\frac{G \cdot 2M}{(2r)^2}}{\frac{G \cdot M}{r^2}} =$
   $\frac{2M \cdot r^2}{M \cdot (2r)^2} =$
   $\frac{2 \cdot r^2}{4r^2} =$
   $\frac{2}{4} =$
   $\frac{1}{2}$
4. Stars A and B have the same density, and star A is 27 times more massive than star B. Calculate the ratio of the gravitational field strength on star A to that on star B.<br>
	 $V_A = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3$<br>
	 $\frac{M_A}{V_A} = \frac{M_B}{V_B}$<br>
	 $M_A = 27 M_B$<br>
	 $\frac{27 M_B}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R_A^3} = \frac{M_B}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R_B^3}$<br>
	 $\frac{27}{R_A^3} = \frac{1}{R_B^3}$<br>
	 $\frac{27}{1} = (\frac{R_A}{R_B})^3$<br>
	 $3 = \frac{R_A}{R_B}$<br>
	 $R_A = 3 R_B$<br><br>
	 $\frac{27 M_B}{(3 R_B)^2} = \frac{R_B^2}{M_B}$<br>
	 $\frac{27}{9 R_B^3} = R_B^3$<br>
	 $\frac{27}{9} =$
	 $\frac{3}{1}$
5. A star explodes and loses half its mass. Its radius becomes half as large. Determine the new gravitational field strength on the surface of the star in terms of the original one.<br>
   $\frac{G \cdot 0.5 M \cdot r^2}{G \cdot M \cdot (0.5 r)^2} =$
   $\frac{0.5 \cdot r^2}{0.25 r^2} =$
   $2$<br>
	 $\therefore g' = 2 g$
6. THe mass of the moon is about 81 times less than that of the earth. Estimate the fraction of the distance from the earth to the moon where the gravitational field strength is zero. (Take into account the earth and the moon only.)<br>
   $\frac{G M_e}{r^2} = \frac{G M_m}{r^2}$<br>
   $Mm = \frac{M_e}{81}$<br>
   $81 = (\frac{x}{d - x})^2$<br>
   $\frac{81 Mm}{x^2} = \frac{Mm}{(d-x)^2}$<br>
   $\sqrt{81} = \frac{x}{d - x}$<br>
   $9 (d - x) = x$<br>
   $9d - 9x = x$<br>
   $9d = 10x$<br>
   $\frac{9}{10} = \frac{x}{d}$

## Sharing Session with Tharsakara

Banyak Belajar, Lari!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Di Kelas bener-bener di perhatiin!
Kalau ga paham, belajar sendiri di asrama!
PENTING Baca buku & beneran paham (bagaimana turunannya)!
Pertanyaan-pertanyaan konsep fisika ada di paper.
Belajar materi di depan materi di kelas.
IA kerjain cepet.
SL fokus ke konsep, perlu latihan soal tapi ga sebanyak HL.
For IA and EE of the same subject,
do the same topic!
This'll result in just one experiment for both IA and EE.
Target: before November!
EE must be finished ASAP.
You may copy the best scorer in EE/IA.
Don't do too high level.
MAKE SURE the presentation is the best.

### Physics IA

Physics subject guide,
focus on the criterions that's easy.
Topik pasaran gpp, yang penting ada modifikasi yang original.
IA dicicil secara rata.
Metode; focus on how to do the experiment.
References is important.
Nyontek past IA gpp!!
IA peer review is good,
it makes sure the presentation criteria is very good.
Know yourself: are you more into experiment or theory?
Diagrams are visuals is bonus point for presentation.
Compare your paper to previous works,
it'll be helpful.
Evaluate the things you lack,
it may cover the drawback.
Most importantly,
have fun!
