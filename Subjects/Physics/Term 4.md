## Newton Law of Gravitation

$F = G \frac{M_1 \cdot M_2}{r^2}$

F is gravitational force
r is distance between to object center to center.
G is a universal gravitational constant ($6.674 \cdot 10^{-11} N m^2 kg^{-2}$)

To apply:
- Point Mass: spherical and of uniform density, one can assume that the entire mass of the body is concentrated at its centre
- Distance is greater than the size of objects

### Learning Check

$F = G \cdot \frac{m^2}{(2 r)^2}$
$F = G \cdot \frac{m^2}{4 r^2}$

$F = G \cdot \frac{m_1 m_2}{4 r^2} + G \cdot \frac{M \cdot m_2}{(2 r)^2}$
$F = \frac{G \cdot m_2}{4 r^2} (m_1 + M)$
Straight to the left.

M/m = 0.75^2 / 0.25^2 = 9.0

### D1. Test Your Understanding

Unless stated otherwise, take the radius and mass of the earth to be 6.4 x 10 6 m and 6.0 x 10 24 kg, respectively.

1. Calculate the gravitational force between:
   1. The earth and the moon (distance between earth and moon = 3.8 x 10 5 km; moon's mass= 7.3 x 10^{22} kg)<br>
      $F = \frac{G \cdot 6.0 \cdot 10^{24} m \cdot 7.3 \cdot 10^{22} m}{(3.8 \cdot 10^8)^2}$<br>
      $F = 2.02438504 \cdot 10^{20} N$<br>
      $F = 2.0 \cdot 10^{20} N$
   2. A proton and an electron separated by 10 -10 m (mass of proton = 1.67 X 10 - 27 kg; mass of electron = 9.11 x 10 - 31 kg).<br>
      $F = \frac{G \cdot 1.67 \cdot 10^{-27} \cdot 9.11 \cdot 10^{-31}}{(10^{-10})^2}$<br>
      $F = 1.01536234 \cdot 10^{-47} N$<br>
      $F = 1.0 \cdot 10^{-47} N$
2. Stars A and B have the same mass, and the radius of star A is nine times larger than the radius of star B. Calculate the ratio of the gravitational field strength on star A to that on star B.<br>
   $g = \frac{G \cdot M}{r^2}$<br>
   $\frac{\frac{G \cdot M}{(9r)^2}}{\frac{G \cdot M}{r^2}} =$
   $\frac{r^2}{(9r)^2} =$
   $\frac{r^2}{81r^2} =$
   $\frac{1}{81}$
3. Planet A has a mass that is twice as large as the mass of planet B and a radius that is twice as large as the radius of planet B. Calculate the ratio of the gravitational field strength on planet A to that on planet B.<br>
   $\frac{\frac{G \cdot 2M}{(2r)^2}}{\frac{G \cdot M}{r^2}} =$
   $\frac{2M \cdot r^2}{M \cdot (2r)^2} =$
   $\frac{2 \cdot r^2}{4r^2} =$
   $\frac{2}{4} =$
   $\frac{1}{2}$
4. Stars A and B have the same density, and star A is 27 times more massive than star B. Calculate the ratio of the gravitational field strength on star A to that on star B.<br>
	 $V_A = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3$<br>
	 $\frac{M_A}{V_A} = \frac{M_B}{V_B}$<br>
	 $M_A = 27 M_B$<br>
	 $\frac{27 M_B}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R_A^3} = \frac{M_B}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R_B^3}$<br>
	 $\frac{27}{R_A^3} = \frac{1}{R_B^3}$<br>
	 $\frac{27}{1} = (\frac{R_A}{R_B})^3$<br>
	 $3 = \frac{R_A}{R_B}$<br>
	 $R_A = 3 R_B$<br><br>
	 $\frac{27 M_B}{(3 R_B)^2} = \frac{R_B^2}{M_B}$<br>
	 $\frac{27}{9 R_B^3} = R_B^3$<br>
	 $\frac{27}{9} =$
	 $\frac{3}{1}$
5. A star explodes and loses half its mass. Its radius becomes half as large. Determine the new gravitational field strength on the surface of the star in terms of the original one.<br>
   $\frac{G \cdot 0.5 M \cdot r^2}{G \cdot M \cdot (0.5 r)^2} =$
   $\frac{0.5 \cdot r^2}{0.25 r^2} =$
   $2$<br>
	 $\therefore g' = 2 g$
