The Doppler effect is the change in [[frequency]] and [[wavelength]] of [waves](Wave) received by an observer due to the relative motion between the source and the observer.
When a sound source is stationary in still air, it emits spherical [wavefronts](Wavefront) at a certain frequency. 

- If an observer moves towards the source, they encounter the wavefronts more frequently, leading to a higher measured frequency, though the wavelength remains unchanged.
- if the observer moves away, they encounter the wavefronts less often, resulting in a lower measured frequency, but the wavelength stays the same.
- If the source moving towards stationary observer, the distance between the wavefront is reduced, which means the receiver frequency will be greater than emitted frequency.
