## Second Law
The rate of change of linear momentum of a particle is directly proportional to the impressed force acting upon it and takes place in the direction of the impressed force.
#### Formula:
F = ∆P / ∆t
	P is momentum
	t is time
∆P = F.∆t = m.∆V = I
	F is force
	t is time
	V is velocity, vector
	I is change in momentum or Impulse
