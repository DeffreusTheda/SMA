# Possible for 40 > IB

IB is about how you spend your efforts.
Lower your standard for IA, EE, or else.
Simple topics is enough to get good points.
Don't spend too much time on advanced IA/EE,
instead give your time for EA.
On EA,
if you can't do a question,
just skip it!
I agree,
IA is better to be done one by one,
until it's really complete.

Remind yourself,
why you're fighting now.
