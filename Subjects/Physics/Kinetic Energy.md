In collision, the kinetic energy transferred between the colliding objects
### Types of collision
1. Elastic:
	Mass is equal, one initially stationary, no energy is lost.
	No permanent deformation on both objects.
	No energy can be released as internal energy (sound, friction, etc.).
	Momentum is conserved.
1.  Inelastic:
	momentum is conserved, unlike energy.
	either perfectly (stick together) or not perfectly (doesn't) inelastic.

### Formula:
- E$_k$=(1/2)mv$^2$
	m is mass
	v is velocity
- E$_k$=p$^2$/2m
	p is momentum
	m is mass
- e = ∆v$_1$ / ∆v$_2$ 
	e is Coefficient of Restitution (COR)
	v$_1$ is velocity after collision
	v$_2$ is velocity before collision
- p after collision = p before collision OR m$_1$v$_1$+m$_2$v$_2$ = m$_1$v'$_1$+m$_2$v'$_2$
