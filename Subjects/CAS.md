# CAS - Creativity, Action, & Service

## What is CAS?

CAS stands for Creativity, Activity, Service.
It's a core part of the IB Diploma Programme that encourages students to develop their skills and interests outside of academics.

## The Three Strands of CAS

Creativity: Activities that involve creative thinking and expression.
Examples: performance expo, art projects, writing, learning a musical instrument.

> ![NOTE]
> Even extracurricular activities can count as CAS if they involve creativity.

Activity: Physical exertion that contributes to a healthy lifestyle.
Examples: sports, dancing, fitness classes.

Service: Contributing to the community through direct or indirect service. You need at least 16 hours of service.
Examples: volunteering, fundraising, research to help your local community, environmental projects.

> ![NOTE]
> Collaboration is encouraged for projects within the creativity strand.<br>
> Performing in a show is considered a CAS activity.

## CAS and TOK (Theory of Knowledge)

CAS experiences can be used to explore TOK questions and reflect on your own beliefs and assumptions.
CAS can also help you consider the ethical implications of your actions and choices.

## CAS Activities and Reflections

- Planning: You need a proposal before starting a CAS activity. There should be clear learning objectives (LOs) associated with your activity. Aim to fulfill 7 different LOs throughout your CAS experiences. It's best to avoid repetitive activities and LOs.
- Evidence collection: Photos, videos, or other documentation are needed as evidence of your participation.
- Reflection: Create a booklet or video reflecting on what you learned from each activity.
- Revision: You can revise your CAS profile at any point.

## CAS Learning Outcomes

1. Strength & growth

Students are able to see themselves as individuals with various skills and
abilities, some more developed than others, and understand that they
can make choices about how they wish to move forward.

2. Challenge & skills

A new challenge may be an unfamiliar experience or an extension of an
existing one. The newly acquired or developed skills may be shown
through experiences that the student has not previously undertaken or
through increased expertise in an established area.

3. Initiative & planning

Students articulate the stages from conceiving an idea to executing a plan for a CAS
experience or series of CAS experiences. This may be accomplished in collaboration with other
participants. Students may show their knowledge and awareness by building on a previous
experience, or by launching a new idea or process.

4. Working collaboratively with others

Collaboration can be shown in many different activities, such as team sports, playing music in
a band, or helping in a kindergarten. At least one project, involving collaboration and the
integration of at least two of creativity, action and service, is required.

5. Showing perseverance and commitment

Students demonstrate regular involvement and active engagement in CAS activities, and
accept a share of the responsibility for dealing with problems that arise in the course of
activities.

6. Global engagement

Students are able to identify and demonstrate their understanding of global issues, make
responsible decisions, and take appropriate action in response to the issue either locally,
nationally or internationally. (for example, environmental concerns, caring for the elderly).

7. Recognize and consider the ethics of choices and actions

Students show awareness of the consequences of choices and actions
in planning and carrying out CAS experiences. Ethical decisions arise in
almost any CAS activity (for example, on the sports field, in musical
composition, in relationships with others involved in service activities).

> ![NOTE]
> All seven outcomes must be present for a student to complete the CAS requirement.<br>
> Some outcomes may be demonstrated many times, in a variety of activities,<br>
> but completion requires only that there is some evidence for every and each outcome.<br>

## My CAS Interview Questions

### Interview 1

1. How do you think your CAS programme will enable you to grow? How do these
   areas of growth apply to the attributes of the IB learner profile?
2. What are your main interests? How can you incorporate these interests into
   your CAS programme?
3. Have you made any plans for creativity? Activity? Service?
   For each, what are you hoping to learn or do you have skills you want to develop?
4. What learning outcome appears as something you will easily do?
5. Have you thought of how you will keep evidence (and the types of evidence)
   that you are engaging with CAS and are meeting the CAS outcomes?

### Interview 2

1. Do you have any questions or concerns about CAS?
2. What do you enjoy doing after school? Could this be part of any CAS
   experience?
3. What would you enjoy doing for creativity? Activity? Service?
4. What learning outcome might present a significant challenge?
5. How will you reflect on your CAS experiences? Are there any preferred ways
   you like to reflect? (Note: The student may require suggestions or examples to
   develop a more diverse approach to reflection.)
