The company previously said it invited 18,000 VMware partners to join its Broadcom Advantage Partner Program. While the exact count of VMware reseller partners varied over the years, in 2023 VMware said it had roughly 25,300 reseller partners in its Partner Connect program, indicating approximately 28 percent of previous VMware partners have been cut.[1]

The first thing to note is that there are going to be job cuts as the company looks to get the most value from the $69bn it has spent on the VMware acquisition. The changes to software licensing also mean enterprise IT buyers may no longer be dealing with the VMware partner they have used in the past when buying new VMware software licences.[3]
Before the deal’s close, customers were concerned about future pricing, product plans, sales coverage and support. In the first quarter since, Broadcom has already started laying off VMware employees, changing how products are bundled and canceling channel contracts.[4]

VMware’s first step under new management was to stop offering perpetual licenses and move to a subscription model. Then, they revamped their product line, dramatically decreasing the number of available offerings: more than half of the features were discontinued, while another part was packed into two bundles, VMware Cloud Foundation and VMware vSphere Foundation, plus an add-on. Needless to say, none of the remaining features can be purchased as standalone offers.[5]
Of course, the existing perpetual licenses for VMware products did not expire, meaning they ‘technically’ could be used indefinitely. However, to receive support, updates, and new software versions, customers always needed to purchase a Support and Subscription (SnS) contract on a subscription basis. This means that, without an active SnS contract, old customers who own perpetual licenses would not be entitled to new versions, direct support from VMware, or critical security updates. As a result, even though the perpetual license remained valid, the unavailability of support and subscription contracts for these licenses renders them hardly usable without ongoing access to updates, support, and security patches. This policy made some old clients suspect they were being pushed into a new model.[5]

Over the years, VMware has been a versatile solution catering to enterprises, small businesses, and individuals. And, while this transition to more consolidated packages didn’t seem to affect big organizations, representatives of small businesses using lightweight VMware deployments flooded the Internet with their renewal proposals. For example, a small VMware partner commented on Reddit that they have seen their renewal costs spike from $10,000 to $50,000, marking a 5x increase. Another user complained that their essential service subscription would cost them 25 times more than their previous one. Another Redditor that represented a British university was expecting to face up to a 1250% uplift, from £40,000 to £500,000 annually, once their support contract expires in 12 months. We should note that all the above examples represent the users’ personal experiences. However, the trend suggests a significant direction: Broadcom is raising prices to make their substantial investments pay off and maximize short-term revenue.[5]

VMware rival and hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) provider Nutanix – which has previously shared its intent to capitalize on Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware – claims VMware customers are turning to Nutanix for advice on “minimizing their exposure to these Broadcom changes,” Nutanix SVP of Product and Solutions Marketing Lee Caswell wrote in a blog post.[4]

Opinion For many, VMware by Broadcom has meant misery by the boatload. The virtualization platform's new owners have embarked on price hikes for the big and forcible eviction for the little. The dividing line isn't clear. A 24,000 VM migration by share repository Computershare seemingly triggered by the gouge suggests things might not go to plan. They may not agree. In the right light, a 24,000 VM migration looks awfully like proof of concept for a 240,000 VM migration.[7]

From observations at r/vmware, various clients expressed their distress at the increase of licensing price, up to a tenfold increase. “A 10 year old account has only one post and it’s just about this VMWare price increase.”  One of the clients stated, “Yep we have 960 core count sitting on ucs as well ours went from 72k to 350k before any “discounts” for 3 year agreement. One year was about 500k . CIO said we got three years to replace everything. Public government sector.” Clearly, Broadcom aims it’s customer to be the high-end companies, as can be seen in one of the comment, “Similar situation here in K-12, the removal of edu discounts, robo licenses as an option, plus the min 16 core per socket subscription means that our small, already ‘right sized’ edge servers at schools resulted in an 8X price increase from our last renewal. They're asking for money that doesn't exist in public education, so we're out.” A client even suggested filing FTC complaints. 
“I work for a fortune 100 company that just today came together and made the decision that even though their new pricing isn’t bad for us, we’re still moving to something else. The overall decision was, they’ve raised their prices on some of their most loyal customers. when the company goes down the toilet, they’ll raise it on the last few remaining customers when they least expect it, and those may be the hardest ones to move to another platform.” [9]

During Broadcom’s Investor Day in late 2021, the company said 70 percent of its total annual recurring revenue came from roughly 600 accounts operating in mostly hybrid cloud environments, with roughly 100 clients spending over $10 million in annual recurring revenue on Broadcom. For Broadcom’s smaller commercial side of the business, approximately 100,000 clients accounted for only roughly 6 percent of Broadcom’s total annual recurring revenue as of November 2021. Comparatively, VMware focuses on serving its more than 300,000 vSphere clients and over 400,000 total customer-base. VMware also touts that 100 percent of all the Fortune 500 companies use its products.[11]
Broadcom said it hopes to increase VMware’s profitability from $4.7 billion in fiscal year 2022 to $8.5 billion within the next few years, in part, by “eliminating duplicative general and administration functions across human resources, finance, legal, facilities and information technology.” This also resulted in massive lay-offs. For its first fiscal quarter, VMware spent $1.053 billion on marketing and sales with total revenue of $3.088 billion for the quarter. Additionally, general administrative costs for VMware were $251 million.[11]
This means VMware spent roughly 42 percent of its total revenue on marketing, sales and general administrative costs. Meanwhile, in Broadcom’s recent second fiscal quarter, the company spent $368 million on “selling, general and administrative” costs, generating a total of $8.103 billion in revenue, according to its financial earnings report. This means Broadcom’s selling, general and administrative costs represented about 4.5 percent of the company’s total sales—significantly less than VMware’s spending 42 percent of its total revenue on these operational costs.[11]
These top 600 “strategic” enterprise accounts have difficulty switching away from VMware due to complex IT environments, allowing Broadcom to cut down R&D and only invest in features needed by the top 600. Similarly, sales and marketing costs will be cut dramatically since the captive top 600 require less convincing to stay. Broadcom openly admits they will let services and features for smaller VMware customers “trail off” over time as they are deprioritized. This approach allows Broadcom to rapidly increase its margins and earnings from VMware through significant cost reductions. But it achieves short-term financial bumps by exploiting VMware’s market position, not through innovation or serving customer needs.
For its most recent first quarter, VMware spent $774 million on research and development (R&D). This R&D cost represented about 25 percent of VMware’s total $3.09 billion in revenue. Comparatively, Broadcom spent $1.26 billion on R&D to achieve its $8.103 billion in total sales for its recent second quarter. Broadcom’s R&D costs represent approximately 15 percent of the company’s total revenue.
Not 3000. The top 100 make 44%, next 200 make 19%, next 300 make 11% so 74% of revenue. Next 6000 make another 20%, the remaining 100000+ accounts make 6%. Expect most of the support resources were being drained by the last 2.

“vSAN capacity licenses is what will kill us. According to CDWG pricing it went from ~$60k/yr to $1M/yr.” -> 16.7x
“27k/yr to 98k/yr for our 9 host cluster” -> 3.63x
“7k to 75k. Mostly due to robo licenses being taken away” -> 10.7x
“vsphere ent license went from 5k to 15k for a 3 host cluster.” -> 3x
“This feels like buying up a popular life saving pharmaceutical and jacking up the price 1000%.”
“they stated that directly in the first few announcements after the Broadcom purchase. Something about focusing on the top 600 customers or some such BS.”
Broadcom's stated strategy is very simple: focus on 600 customers who will struggle to change suppliers, reap vastly lower sales and marketing costs by focusing on that small pool, and trim R&D by not thinking about the needs of other customers – who can be let go if necessary without much harm to the bottom line.( November 2021 Investor Day) [10]
Broadcom has approximately 20,000 employees worldwide, while VMware has over 35,000 employees. If completed, Broadcom’s software group will rebrand and operate as VMware, which will incorporate Broadcom’s existing infrastructure and security software solutions.

Personally, I used VMWare Fusion on my Mac M1 when I was learning about Linux and just trying it out.
