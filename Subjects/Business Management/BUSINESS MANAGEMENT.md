- Discuss 2 possible areas of conflict between the stakeholders in the alumbre project!
	"Ecosoluciones
	Ecosoluciones is a non-profit research organization located in Madrid, Spain. One of their objectives is to try to introduce non-polluting sources of electricity in developing countries.
	
	One successful application of their research was the Alumbre Project. This provided electricity created by wind generators to the remote village of Alumbre, Peru, which previously had none.

	In Alumbre, wind generators were installed by Ecosoluciones to supply, for the first time, electricity to a textile factory, one of the few firms in the area operating in the secondary sector. Ecosoluciones also agreed to maintain and repair the generators. There was a complete transformation in the production process. The factory was able to buy new machinery. Productivity increased dramatically.
	New jobs were created.
	
	Ecosoluciones also promised, in partnership with Peru Telecom and the Peruvian government, to help fund the improvements in communication between Alumbre and the rest of Peru. This also allowed regional trade to develop. The entire community experienced significant improvements in their quality of life. The Peruvian government saw this as a practical solution to develop other depressed areas* of the country.
	
	Unfortunately in 2008 a severe financial crisis hit Europe and the Spanish government suspended part of its funding for research organizations such as Ecosoluciones. As a direct result, the management of Ecosoluciones felt it may no longer be able to maintain Alumbre's wind generators."

	- Itaborai is a perfect place for development of an project; money laudereer for Petrobras (Oil Company; Government owned) -> enrich criminals 
	- Companies work together to make Petrobras pay more for them for the projects finished. -- Petrobras stock cut in half, worker lost their jobs; 
	- This all happened over Latin America
	- The scandal affect almost all of Brazil (11 stopped, 6 more in outer countries, and 23 in Venezuela);
	- Uncover truth; but destroy the stability of the country;
	- Cartel: work together to set a high fixed price to 'exploit' the consumers

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Economies & Diseconomies of Scale</h3>
## 2023-09-07
- Economies of scale
	- The larger the organization, the more efficient the business becomes and this therefore leads to a lower unit costs
	- For example apple in the beginning costs $400  to produce one unit of iPhone, but now since it became bigger it costs $250
	- Types of EoS:
		- Internal Eos:
			- Purchasing economies: A.K.A. bulk-buying economies is when suppliers offer discounts on larger orders as it usually cheaper for them to process and deliver; They are also influenced by the EoS
			- Financial economies: refers to bank having a preference towards larger businesses (seems less risky) which results in lower lending rates 
			  *IB lists up that obtaining finance through the use of issuance of shares to the public can be very expensive which makes it lower average costs for firms that are selling shares that worth a lot; If you're a big companies who shares issuance to the public markets, theses shares is spread widely and easily, thus more cash coming in which in turn lower the average costs per unit* ^277fcf
			- Technical (Production) economies: advanced technological equipment is often very expensive, making it only affordable to big firms as the average fixed costs gets reduced with a higher output level (high capacity levels); The fixed costs is spread over higher amount of unit, thus lowering the average costs per unit ^4b58f3
			- Managerial economies: refers to boosted productivity and output due to larger firms being able to afford more specialized managers
			- Marketing economies: Marketing costs can be spread out over a higher level of sales, leading to EoS; If you're a small business, you still need to employ some sort of marketing by paying an agency to make an advertisement for your products, and this fee is spread over small quantity of goods which make it more expensive per unit. This means that the advertisement costs can be spread to higher quantity of output, thus lowering average unit costs. although with the drawback that marketing costs also increase a little when the business grow
		- External EoS (& DoS)
			- for example, because there is so many Tech-firms in the Silicon Valley, there may also be more potential employees that are specialized in technologies looking for a job there (lower HR recruiting costs, more expertise)
- Diseconomies of scale
	- The opposite of EoS (Economies of Scale); Usually regarding communications and coordination; for example DoS occurs due to the size of the industry in a particular area, it leads to traffic congestion leading to increased costs

- Product = **total cost**; Fx. sari roti need flour, packaging, ads, water, transportation, worker/salary, etcetera; **Total cost / products made = average cost**
	- **Fixed Cost** (Constant; no matter how many products made, this value is the same always; Fx. house renting prices (you still pay even if you don't use it, your belongings stay there)) + **Variable Cost** (Increase linearly with the total cost/number of production)
- Questions
	- TFC: 22,000 + 5000 + 3,000 + 2,000 = 32,000
	- AVC: 150 + 40 + 265 = 455
	- AC: (TVC + TFC) / 700 = 455 + 32,000)

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Small vs Large Organizations</h3>
## 2023-10-10
- Small organizations: there is universal definitions for a 'small business', but most countries have some sort of definition of the size of the company, for example 
	- Medium: 51-250
	- Small: 11-50
	- Micro: 10 or fewer
	- Advantages: 
		-  More control and managing power to the owner
		- Quick adaptability to customers need
		- Personal service to customers, better connection
		- Easier communication, better bonding between employees

	- Disadvantages:
		- Limitations of sources of finance
		- Carry large responsibility as the owner, the organization can afford to employ specialist managers
		- Less diversification, more risk to negative external changes in that particular area
		- No economies of scale
- Large organizations:
	- Advantages:
		- Afford to employ specialist professional managers, more expertise; This can lead to business bing more efficient
		- Benefits to costs reduction linked with large scale production; Production EoS [[#^4b58f3]]

		- Better sources of finance; Financial EoS [[#^277fcf]]
		- May be diversified into other markets (& products) meaning risks is spread; R&D can be afforded because they have more capital
	- Disadvantages: 
		- More difficult to manage, especially on spread geographical location
		- Potential for diseconomies of scale
		- Suffering of poorer communications & slower decision making due to organization structure

						- Horizontal integration: have the same products and market, for reducing competitor ("rather than competing, let's just work together")
						- Backward & Upward Vertical integration: in supply chain, buying shares from upper or lower companies, backward for with lower whereas upper with higher companies; <- Distribution -> wholesale -> retail
							- Forward fx.: vehicle company buy car part company (car part company is earlier in operation chain)
							- Upward Integration buy the next one in operating chain
							- Used to minimize the dependency of companies to supplier/retailer
							- fx. Disney & American Broadcasting []; Starbuck bought The Clover Brewing System
						- Conglomeration (merger alike): expanding business by combining different range of business, mostly with companies from another countries
							- fx. Alibaba Express & Lazada, Alibaba distance group, etc.
							- fx. Rafi Ahmad's Entertainment -> football club, clothes, entertainment, beach club, e-sport club
							- fx. Rolls Royce
							- fx. Sinar Mas, selling not only books
				- Joint Ventures
					- Two or more business who closely **work together on a particular projects with a limited time,** and create a separate business division to do the job; they both share profits or losses and investment
						- fx. Samsung & Spotify
					- Take over
						- Friendly takeover (Acquisition): with approval of bought company
						- Hostile takeover: more forced, not aligned with the want of bought company
				- Strategic Alliances: collaborative, share goals and commit resources to achieve that goal; the company doesn't combine and this alliance end when the shared goals are achieved
					- Compared to takeover & joint ventures:
						- + = competition reduced; creation of synergy; lower distribution cost and logistical problems; easier to do & reserve; allow firm to have new product and market
						- - = profit is shared; communication issues from difference; prone to conflicts and disagreement between company 
					- A + B = A + B: work together but still retain their own products
				- Franchise: a franchisor rights to sell to a franchisee, in return of fee and/or set percentage of annual sales turnover (royalty); a business that uses the name, logo and trading systems of an existing successful business
					- less risky and costly than starting a new business entirely
					- fx. Subway & McDonald's
					- Advantage: no need for creativity; way lower start-up failure rate; gain the same acknowledgement and fame of the franchisor; you can be seen as having more credibility
					- Disadvantage: initial costs from buying products from the franchisor; dependent on franchisor; must follow the franchisor's want; prone to bad reputation giving from other franchisee; reduced risk = lower profit

- Multinational Company
	- Difference with international marketing: international company is based on one country, but the products are exported to other countries; whereas multinational company have branch(s) in other country(s)
	- Headquarters is the biggest, subsidiaries is the branches in other country
	- Why are the products made in other country?
		- Lower production, transportation, & labor costs
	- Reason
		- Increase customer base
		- Cheaper production cost
		- Economies of scale
		- Brand development & brand value
		- Avoid protectionist policies (tariffs, quotas, restrictive trade practices)
		- Spread risk
			- If one branch is lost then the other is minimally affected
				- fx. McDonald's in Russia; Chitos & Giant in Indonesia;
	- Positive impact on host/branch's country
		- Avoid taxes
		- Support economies of host country
		- Support local business
			- fx. buy materials from local business
		- Increase workforces
		- Better quality of product
	- Negative impact on host/branch's country
		- Dominating local company
		- Some of the profits return to headquarter (ideally just for themselves in their own view)
		- Human resources in local area maybe subpar, thus there's a need to send experts from outer country
		- Influencing local cultures through its products
	- fx. Multinational Company:
		- McDonald's
		- Samsung
		- Apple
		- Unilever
		- Indofood
		- Nike

- Decision tree
	- This value of probability is just an estimate, and can be influenced by so many factors such as politics, social, etc.
	- fx. Drisner Traders Ltd.:
		- a) Construct a decision tree to show which of the two locations is best for Drisner Traders Ltd., based on financial grounds. (need to be balanced, choose either one)
			- fx. they need to choose South Korea because it's more profitable, thus more beneficial to them
			- Kazakhstan: $250,000
				- High return (60%): $400,000 -> $240,000
				- Low return (40%): $250,000 -> $100,000
				- Return = ($240,000 + $100,000) - $250,000 = $90,000
			- South Korea: $175,000
				- High return (75%): $300,000 -> $225,000 
				- Low return (25%): $180,000 -> $45,000
				- Return = ($225,000 + $45,00) - $175,000 = $95,000
		- b) Discuss the value of decision trees as a decision-making tool for Drisner Traders Ltd. (Determine the negative and positive impact and balanced, must be refer/mention and proved by the case, then make conclusion)
	- Shapes & symbols
		- Square is decision making, the first thing in decision tree, usually used as place for note

# Balance Sheet

Mirip neraca atau timbangan, timbangan harus sama - hutang dan asset.
Semakin banyak asset, semakin banyak utang.

Kolom kanan namanya 'Aktiva' dan kiri sebagai 'Passiva'.
Aktiva harus sama deengan nominal di Passiva.
Di dunia nyata, kedua hal ini tidak ada, hanya merupakan konsep.

Aktiva hanya punya satu akun yaitu asset, sedangkan Passiva mempunyai Liability and Equity (modal dari investor).
Modal, dipandang sebagai hutang dalam bisnis, harus dikembalikan.

Jika seimbang maka:
Total asset = Liability + Equity
