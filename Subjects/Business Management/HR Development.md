## -- External Factors Influencing Hr Planning
External means the company can't control that factor(s).
You can only plan and recruit only for necessary section of your business.
- For example Indonesia 2045; Demographic change influences supply of labor:
	- Size of population.
	- Growth of population:
		- Net birth rate.
		- Net migration.
		- Retirement age.
	- Gender.
- Changes in Labour Mobility -- Workers have the ability and willingness to move between geographical locations and/or occupations for their employment.
- Immigration -- recruiting migrant workers can help businesses to meet their short term HR needs.
- Flexitime -- Employees have the autonomy to determine when they work, and set the deadline for work completed -- Can be formed as teleworking and home-working.
- Gig Economy -- can create gig workers (freelancers) -- you don't need to hire a people for occupation, just pay them only when you need them.

Human resource planning can be achieved by looking at:
- Historical data and trends -- allow company to prepare stocks:
	- for example during lebaran the demand increased thus the workers employed increase.
- Sales and income levels.
- Labour turnover rates is the rate of worker leaving -- effected by the condition (culture, work ethics, facilities, etc.) of the company:
	- formula: employees leaving, divided by employee stay, multiplied by 100%
- The flexibility and workload of employees.
- Demographic changes.
- Resistance to change in the workplace:
	- Different assessment or interpretation of situation.
	- Self interest -- they only care for themselves than for the company.
	- Low tolerance -- people prefer familiarity than disruption and uncertainties.
	- Misinformation -- misunderstanding when the changes has not been communicated effectively.
