Place refers to the distribution of [products](product), i.e. how products get from the [[producer]] to the [[consumer]]. The Chartered Institure of Management defines place (or **distribution**) as "Getting the right products to the right customers, at the right price, in the right place and the right time."

The distribution decision requires management skills in persuading [retailers](retailer) to stock a firm's products.
Retailers such as supermarkets have limited shelf and floor space so will only want to hold supplies of products that sell well.
Cinemas have a limited number of screens so only purchase and show movies that will generate high sales revenues.
Window displays in real estate agencies are very limited so the adverts they choose to display need to get quick sales.
In essence, marketing managers need to **convince distributors and other intermediaries to sell their products rather than rival products from competitors**.
Place in the [[marketing mix]] also addresses the [geographical](geography) distribution of products (local, national or international).
