	<h2>Charles Handy's "Gods of management"</h2>
		<p>Charles Handy's model of culture is based on the way in which organizations are structured. <b>A single organization may have more than one of these cultures</b> because parts of the organization may be structured differently and because of different occupational/professional cultures.</p>
	
	<h3>Zeus - Power Culture</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Zeus was extremely powerful as the god of thunder and lightning. In a power culture, an individual or a small group of senior staff, makes decisions for the organization; the lower group can't intervene; leader have big power.</li>
		<li>Power and authority are concentrated in the hands of the elite few at the top of the organization, who strive to maintain absolute control over their employees; leaders are autocratic; meeting is minimal;</li>
		<li>Communication is highly centralized; procedures and formal rules is insignificant; no bureaucratic processes to slow things down.</li>
		<li>Driven by result, relatively cheap to operate and decisions can be made quickly; thus power culture organization is generally small.</li>
		<li>Can give negative effect to the staff, because they can't express their opinion, thus higher rate of turnover; no sense of belonging, thus loyalty is subpar; productivity can be affected negatively.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Apollo - Role Culture</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Son of Zeus; God of archery, art, knowledge, light, medicine, and poetry.</li>
		<li>Operations and organization norms are underpinned. Clear policies and hierarchies exist in order to facilitate the smooth running of the business.</li>
		<li>Workers gave clearly defined roles and responsibilities and operate within clear rules and guidelines.</li>
		<li> Common in bureaucratic organization with tall organizational structures and long chains of command, including colleges and universities. A worker's responsibilities and authority are determined by their respective level in the organizational hierarchy.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Athena - Task Culture</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li> Teams of experts are empowered to complete a project and tackle a problem with their particular skills.</li>
		<li> Senior managers endure the ream consist of the best mix of people, and that they are supported to achieve their objectives; Depends largely on group dynamics, team cohesiveness, and interpersonal skills in the workplace.</li>
		<li> Appropriate in dynamic, creative, innovative, and forward-looking organization.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Dionysus - Person Culture</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li> Greek son of wine, winemaking, and theatre.</li>
		<li> People regard themselves or their skills set as being more important than the organization itself; Organization only exist to help individuals to achieve their personal and professional goals.</li>
		<li> Values each person as an expert, and relies on their skills and experiences for the organization to succeed and thrive.</li>
		<li> Employs a cluster of individuals with similar skills, qualifications, talents, and expertise.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Cultural Clashes</h2>
	
	<p>Happen when organization change. Causes of culture clashes are as follows:</p>
	
	<h3>Growth</h3>
	
	<p>Internal growth (Organic) often disconnect junior staff members and senior managers in very large organizations; beliefs and values of employees differ, therefore leading to a culture clash. <br> Growth and evolution can disrupt the existing organizational cultures, causing uncertainties and worry to employees.<p>
	
	<h3>Merger</h3>
	
	in External growth (Inorganic), one culture is more dominant, so conflict is likely to occur, especially in hostile take over, against the wishes of the target company, or when the two organizations are from vastly different regional cultures.
	70-90% mergers and acquisitions fail because of culture clashes.
	
	<h3>Leadership Styles</h3>
	
	When leadership style change, differing views, approaches, and priorities may conflict, leading to culture clashes. Employees, especially longer serving members are difficult to adapt and conform to a different leader and the subsequent new vision for the organization.
	A new leader often feels they have to prove themselves, so introduce change based on their own ideas for the organization. This establishes a new culture.
