The Special Region of Yogyakarta (D.I.Y) is well known as the 'city of student' and a culturally rich tourist city in Middle Java. Various popular tourist sites like Malioboro, Candi Prambanan, and Gunungkidul Beaches also present in Yogyakarta. There are many campus around the city, and many graduates from these campuses choose to work and build a house in Yogyakarta. But, working in Yogyakarta has its own drawback, one of which is the low minimum wage. In fact, it's the lowest in the entire country, and there are multiple reasons that contribute to that discussed in the following.

According to the DIY government's January 2023 determination, the 2023 minimum wage (UMP) in Yogyakarta is set at Rp 1,981,782. This figure represents a 7.65% increase from the 2022 UMP of Rp 1,840,915. The minimum wage by regency/city (UMP) range from the lowest in Gunungkidul Regency at Rp 2,049,266 and the highest in Yogyakarta City at Rp 2,324,775.50. Compared to other cities like Bandung with a UMP of Rp 4,048,462.69 and Semarang with a UMP of Rp 3,060,348.78, Yogyakarta City has a lower UMP.

Looking through the empirical glass as a resident, it's apparent that the governor itself aimed Yogyakarta to be the 'student city' it's known today rather than a job-centered metropolitan. To balance this, the living costs in Yogyakarta is very low and thus very attractive for outsiders. If the UMP were to be increased as of currently, there would be an inflation, tourist count would plummet, and businesses would start to move away from Yogyakarta.

Due to that attractiveness, many businesses came to Yogyakarta, which bump job opportunities in Yogyakarta. The presence of various campuses improve overall worker quality which lead to high competitiveness in the job market. This makes Yogyakarta perfect for new businesses searching for great worker with low wages. On the other hand, the cheap standard of living in Yogyakarta which also has an impact on low wages. Although some basic necessities are cheap, in certain contexts, land prices in Yogyakarta are really high.

Despite that, the happiness index (IPM) in Yogyakarta is one of the highest in Indonesia, sitting at 72.08 in 2021. In addition, according to data, the correlation value between IPM and UMP is 0.03, a very low correlation or even maybe no correlation at all. The high quality education there also help to improve health awareness and lifestyle.

Furthermore, the atmosphere of Yogyakarta City is thick with Javanese philosophy that is full of meaning, is considered to also support a different atmosphere of welfare than other cities. Many people in Yogyakarta, especially those who live in rural areas, also see subjective aspects of welfare. This means that welfare is not only about economics, but also about living in harmony, mutual respect, and so on.

Meanwhile, responding to the fact that there are quite a lot of graduates in Yogyakarta campuses who work in this Special Region, Hempri said that this is beyond the issue of UMP. According to him, entering the workforce is not just about looking for high salaries to start with. This is because there are other important things to consider for personal development. "Work maybe should be in accordance with passion, yes. It doesn't mean just high salaries. By working according to passion, it is guaranteed to increase enthusiasm and work ethic," he explained.

In conclusion, Yogyakarta's low UMP is a multifaceted issue and is intricately linked to the city's identity as a student hub and cultural center. The government's strategy has succeeded in fostering a unique environment where education, culture, and quality of life thrive despite economic limitations. The high happiness index and strong cultural values demonstrate that well-being in Yogyakarta extends beyond monetary considerations. Yogyakarta is an example of how traditional economic indicators may not always fully capture the complete picture of welfare and satisfaction.
