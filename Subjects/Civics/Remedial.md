# Civics Remedial

<!-- Tentang Indonesia, only one thing, and hand written.
-->

The Special Region of Yogyakarta (D.I.Y) is well known as the 'city of student' dan a culturally rich tourist city in Middle Java.
Various popular tourist sites like Malioboro, Candi Prambanan, and Gunungkidul Beaches also present in Yogyakarta.
There are many campus around the city, and not a few of graduates from these campuses choose to work and build a house in Yogyakarta.

Yogyakarta is considered one of the most affordable cities in Indonesia, making it an attractive destination for students, expats, and tourists alike.
But, this has its own drawback, one of which is the low minimum wage.
In fact, it's the lowest in the entire country.
This has made me pondering my mind for a long time.

## UMP in Yogyakarta

UMP (*upah minimum provinsi*) is the name for the minimum wage issued in a province.

According to the DIY government's January 2023 determination, the 2023 minimum wage (UMP) in Yogyakarta is set at Rp 1,981,782.
This figure represents a 7.65% increase from the 2022 UMP of Rp 1,840,915.

The minimum wage by regency/city (UMP) is as follows:

- Yogyakarta City: Rp 2,324,775.50
- Sleman Regency: Rp 2,159,519.22
- Bantul Regency: Rp 2,066,438.82
- Kulon Progo Regency: Rp 2,050,447.15
- Gunungkidul Regency: Rp 2,049,266

Compared to other cities like Bandung with a UMP of Rp 4,048,462.69 and Semarang with a UMP of Rp 3,060,348.78, Yogyakarta City has a lower UMP.

## Why is the UMP in Yogyakarta So Low?

<!-- Dr.
Hempri Suyatna, S.Sos., M.Si., a lecturer at FISIPOL and a researcher at the Center for People's Economy Studies at UGM, explains several reasons why Yogyakarta has a low minimum wage.
-->

One reason is that there are not many job opportunities available in Yogyakarta.
This can lead to less competition between companies for workers, which in turn can lead to lower wages being offered.

On the other hand, the standard of living in Yogyakarta is not high, which also has an impact on low wages.
One-bedroom apartment in the city center only cost around $130-$170 per month.

However, it is important to pay attention to improving labor welfare standards in Yogyakarta.
Although some basic necessities are cheap, in certain contexts, land prices in Yogyakarta are really high.

## UMP and Yogyakarta's Culture

Despite that, the happiness index in Yogyakarta is known to be one of the highest in Indonesia, sitting at 72.08 in 2021.
<!--However, the government still needs to pay attention to the UMP aspect.

This is because with a higher UMP, people's purchasing power improve as well.-->

If indeed the UMP is difficult to raise, the aspects of social security for workers must be considered so that they can still feel comfortable.
This can include as example BPJS Ketenagakerjaan dan Keseharan.

On the other hand, the atmosphere of Yogyakarta City, which is thick with Javanese philosophy that is full of meaning, also support a different perspective on welfare than other cities.
Some people in Yogyakarta, especially those who live in rural areas, see subjective aspects of welfare.
They believe that welfare is not only about economics, but also about living in harmony, mutual respect, health, and so on.

Happiness index are not affiliated with several planning documents in the Province of the Special Region of Yogyakarta.

A study titled “Poor but Happy: Life Struggle and the Meaning of Happiness among the Poor in Yogyakarta”, found that despite a high poverty rate in the region, the residents were among the top ranks in the National Human Happiness Index in 2014 and 2017.
The study concluded that the respondents were not happy living in poverty but were content with their lives due to their belief system and local culture.

## Working According to Passion

A lot of graduates in Yogyakarta campuses who work in this Special Region, beyond the issue of UMP.

According to him, entering the workforce is not just about looking for high salaries to start with.
This is because there are other important things to consider for personal development.

"Work maybe should be in accordance with passion, yes.
It doesn't mean just high salaries.
By working according to passion, it is guaranteed to increase enthusiasm and work ethic," he explained.

There's an sizeble amount of resident who work in UMKM (Usaha Mini, Kecil, Menengah).
10 persen dari populasi DIY kini memilih untuk berkarir di sektor ini.
10% of the DIY population choose to take a career in this sector.
This is caused by the rich culture and enterpreourship.
