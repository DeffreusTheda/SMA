# Internet Protocol
Above: [[Network]]
Related: [[Intranet]]

Set of rules for transmission of data packets.
Protocols:
 TCP/IP is the protocol for transfer across the internet.
 HTTPS is the protocol for data transfer between a web browser and a server.
 SFTP stand for Secure File Transfer Protocol; from client to server and vice versa.
Role of protocols:
 Maintain data integrity; received data is the sama as the sent data.
 Flow control; same rate between data transfer: received and sent.
 Prevent deadlock; two packet's don't "block each other"; they don't collide with each other.
 Prevent errors; Make sure no errors introduced in the transit.
Different protocol use different layer in the [[OSI model]]
