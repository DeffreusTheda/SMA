# A

content (500 words) and appendix (!wordCount, but contents page)
1. [ ] Problem must be discussed.
2. [ ] Identify client/advisor.
3. [ ] Consult the client, at least 3 times in appendix, on start/mid/end. 1:explaining the problem, 2:alternative research feedback and agreeing for Java, 3:agree on Success Criteria.
