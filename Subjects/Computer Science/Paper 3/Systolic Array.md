In systolic array, each DPU independently {1:**computes a partial result**} as a function of the data **received** from {1:its **upstream** neighbors}, {2:**stores**} the result within {1:**itself**} and **passes** it {1:**downstream**}.
This **wave**-like (blood vessel) **propagation** coined the term systolic from medical terminology.
