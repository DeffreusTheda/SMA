Involves complying with legal and ethical standards.

## Data Privacy and Security

Ensures that sensitive personal information is kept confidential and secure from unauthorized access or exposure.
Importance in neural networks: often handle confidential user data (personal details & transaction information), essential to maintain user trust.

- **Anonymization** of training data.
- Secure data handling
	- Secure **encryption** methods
	- **Access controls** on storage or during transmission
- **Regulation compliance** such as data protection regulation (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

## Bias and Fairness

- Diverse training data.
- Implement bias detection and mitigation.
- Regular audits and reviews.

## Accountability and Responsibility

- Clear governance structures, defining who is responsible for aspects of the models' deployment and usage.
- Documentation and transparency.
- Ensure human oversight and intervene model's incorrect/harmful decisions.

## Transparency

- Implement techniques to explain how the model comes to its conclusion.
- Communicate limitations, strengths, and potential biases.
- Allow users feedback and issues report.

## Misinformation and Manipulation

- Fact-check and validate model's output.
- Train model on credible and reliable sources.
- Continuously monitor model's output and correct observed inaccuracies.
