In [[neural network]], bias of a model comes from the biases of its [[dataset]].
This can lead to:

- Unfair or discriminatory responses
- Favor certain groups or viewpoints
- Reducing its accuracy and fairness
	- User dissatisfaction
	- Potential ethical and legal issues

## Sampling Bias

Not representative of the entire population -> good only for specific user groups and fails to generalize to others.

Biased towards certain dialects or formal language, reducing understanding to what else (informal or diverse language patterns).
Result in inaccurate responses.
