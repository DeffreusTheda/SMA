Structured sequence (pipeline) of machine learning models and algorithms working together to progressively transform and interpret user input.
Each step contribute to understanding and accuracy.
Modular and sequential design for handling complex tasks.

Example:

- Input
- Tokenization
- [[Bag-of-Words]]
- etc.
- Output

Stages:

1. [[Lexical Analysis|Lexical analysis]]
2. [[Syntactic analysis]]
3. [[Semantic Analysis|Semantic analysis]]
4. [[Discourse Integration|Discourse integration]]
5. [[Pragmatic Analysis|Pragmatic analysis]]

## Advantages

- Accuracy:
	- each model contribute to understanding and interpretation of user input.
- Efficiency:
	- each step focus and optimized on specific tasks
- Adaptability:
	- [[Modularity|modular]]; easy updates and improvements to individual components
