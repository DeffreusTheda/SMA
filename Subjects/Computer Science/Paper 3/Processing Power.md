Steps to **improve processing power:
- {1:**Pre-processing** [[dataset]]}
	- {2:Cleaning}, {2:transforming}, and {2:reducing} the data to improve its **quality** and make it easier for the algorithms to process efficiently
- Utilize hardwares such as {1:**[[Graphical Processing Unit|GPUs]] or [[Tensor Processing Unit|TPUs]]**}
	- Provide parallelization for {2:handling **queries simultaneously**}
- Unsure **sufficient** {1:**storage and memory**}
	- Ensure {2:**scalability**} during peak times during launch or promotional campaign
	- Maintain {2:**quick response time**}
- {1:**Distributed**} computing
	- Able to handle {2:**multiple queries**} simultaneously **without** significant {2:**latency**}
- {1:Software optimization}
	- Implement {2:**efficient NLP algorithms**} such as pruning and quantization
