A mathematical function that measure the errors of the model output against the expected output.
During [[backpropagation]], the loss function is used to calculate the error, which is then propagated backward through the network.
The [[Gradient Descent|gradients]] of the loss function with respect to each weight are computed.
This process is crucial for guiding the network towards more accurate predictions.
Commonly uses [[Mean Squared Error|MSE]].
