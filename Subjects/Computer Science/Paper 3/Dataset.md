## Diversity 

**Dataset diversity** refers to the inclusion of a wide range of topics, languages, dialects, and user intents in the training data.

- Helps generalize better and respond accurately to different types of queries, scenarios, and user interactions.

## Real vs Synthetic

**Synthetic data** is artificially generated data that simulates real user interactions.

- Can be customized.
- Augment real data.
- Cover scenarios that may not be well-represented in the real data.

## Updates

Regular updates maintains relevance and accuracy.

- Adapt to new trends, user behaviors, and emerging types of queries.
- Continuously incorporate feedback from users.

## Quality

- Data Cleaning
	- Removing irrelevant, duplicate, and noisy data that confuse the model. Ensure the remaining data is accurate and well-labeled.
- Data Augmentation
	- Generating [[#Real vs Synthetic|synthetic data]] to cover under-represented scenarios.
- Bias Mitigation
	- Analyze potential biases and address them.
- User Feedback
	- Identify and correct inaccuracies, improving the dataset's quality.
