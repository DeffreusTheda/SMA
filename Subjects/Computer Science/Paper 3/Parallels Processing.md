Parallel processing involves dividing tasks into smaller sub-tasks that can be executed simultaneously,
leveraging multi-core [[Central Processing Unit|CPUs]], [[Graphical Processing Unit|GPUs]], and [[Tensor Processing Unit|TPUs]].

- Reduces latency; speed up processing times
- Effectively manage high volumes of queries
- Reduce computational load
