{1:Critical path algorithm} is a project management tool, identify the {2:minimum completion time of a project}.
It focus on highlighting {2:longest stretch of dependent activities}.
If critical path delayed, the whole project is delayed.

## Critical Path for Optimization
Focus on critical tasks. Sequentially:
- Data Loading
	- prefetch
	- faster storage
- Forward Pass
	- efficient algorithm
	- GPU/TPU
- Loss Computations
	- efficient code
- Backward Pass
	- hardware acceleration
	- optimized algorithm
- Weight Update
	- efficient resource usage (memory & computational)
