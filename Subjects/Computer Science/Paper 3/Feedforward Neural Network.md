{1:**Feed-Forward Network**}
abbr. {1:FFN}
In {1:[[Transformer Neural Networks|TNNs]]}, is a component that {2:**refines [[Transformer Neural Networks#Self-attention Mechanism|self-attention mechanism]]'s output**}. Each vector is processed independently ({1:position-wise}).
It consist of two FCs: first that {2:maps **to a higher dimensional space** (larger set of numbers)}, am **activation function**, and second that {2:maps **back to original size**}.
