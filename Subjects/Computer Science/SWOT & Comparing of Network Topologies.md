Above: [[Network]]
### --- Advantages (+) and disadvantages (-) of [[LAN]]:
\+ Simple
\+ Cheap upkeep
\+ Fast communication
\+ Sharing of resources
\- Limited Distance
\- Expensive setup
\- Can't be used for huge scale
### Advantages (+) and disadvantages (-) of [[VLAN]]:
\+ Ease broadcast issues by dividing the whole network to groups -- reduces size of broadcast domain
\+ Additional layer of security
\+ Easier devices management
\+ Easy and fast to make changes to the network
\+ Group devices by function instead of location
\+ Help traffic & prevent congestion
\- Costly as it require more router
\- Error in a switch config result in all device connected to it become inaccessible
\- Inability to collaborate with other devices in another subnetwork
\- Possibility of data leak to other VLAN

### Advantages (+) and disadvantages (-) of WLAN:
| Advantages                                                              | Disadvantages                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Can use unlicensed radio spectrum; use it anywhere; no need to register | Interference; e.g fridge disturb router |
| No cables                                                               | Limited range; 20m at most              |
| Can move around                                                         | Security; allow for wireless hacking    | 
| Global Standards (for example 802.11n); connect anywhere                |                                         |
| Minimal setup costs                                                     |                                         |

### Similarity (\==) and differences (!=) between [[LAN]] and [[VLAN]]:
\== Uses switch(es) and router(s)
\== Similar ranges
\== Connect devices
\== Share resources
!= Broadcast domain: LAN is single while VLAN is multiple
!= LAN is more expensive
!= LAN have higher latency
!= standard protocols: LAN use ethernet while VLAN use ISP & VTP
!= VLAN is more efficient; better performance; better for organization
\!= VLAN is more secure
\!= VLAN is more complex to setup

### Advantages (+) and Disadvantages (-) of [[WAN]]:
\+ Largest area of cover, spanning countries
\+ Capable of supporting huge number of computers
\+ Capable of exchanging & transmitting data from very long distance
\+ Higher bandwidth and capacity
\- Slower data transmission due to range
\- More attractive for hacking & exploitation as it contain huge numbers of connected devices
\- Expensive to set up
\- Usually longer problems troubleshooting duration
\- Hard to maintain

### Advantages (+) and Disadvantages (-) of [[VPN]]:

^040d11

\+ Encryption of internet traffic; protect from unwanted outsider reading your data.
\+ Anonymity, Security, & Privacy.
\+ Allow remote access.
\+ Setup is cheaper than setting up a dedicated network infrastructure for remote access.
\+ Geolocation bypass.
\+ Compatible with most devices and operating systems today.
\+ Allow use of VPN provider's faster traffic.
\+ Multiple exit nodes: origin of data unclear, as if it comes from multiple IP address.
\- Slower connection speed as data travel longer distances
\- Limited free server location
\- Inaccessible to some users as it sometime require subscription fee
\- Legal issues in some countries
\- Fraudulent VPN provider may leak data & IP address
\- Unreliable as the connection may face connections drop or disruption

### Difference between [[WAN]] and [[VPN]]:
1. Purpose or usage: WAN connects a huge amount of device; whereas VPN securely & privately connects a device to a virtual personal area as if they're physically in the same space.
2. VPN is intended to be more secure than WAN
3. VPN connect devices through the internet; where as WAN through various means of ways
4. VPN typically cost less to set up; where as WAN require many hardwares and infrastructure thus it's more expensive
5. VPN is simpler to set up; where as WAN is considerably harder to setup due to bigger demand of resources, higher amount of hardwares, and more time-consuming
<br><hr><br>
### Difference between [[LAN]] and [[VPN]]:
1. VPN is more secure than LAN in many cases as it include encryption by default
2. LAN has faster data transmission speed compared to VPN as devices are closer and wired means of data transmission is generally faster than wireless.
3. Similar to VLAN, LAN is more expensive compared to VPN
