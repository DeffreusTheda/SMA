![[computer_network_topology.png]]

A computer network is formed when two or more computers are linked together.
Every computer in a network can send and receive data from other connected devices in the network.

There are multiple types of computer network: 

- P2P

These are the devices used to connect different computers:

- Hub<br>
	Connection point for all devices in the network.
	Send data to all connected devices to its port.
	Generates lot of unnecessary traffic on the network, thus not as efficient as switch.
- Switch<br>
	It's the same as hub but:
		Send data to devices that need it.
		Know which device is connected to which port.
		Operate faster compared to hub.
- Router<br>
	Connect multiple networks.
	Serves as an intermediary between networks, allowing them to connect.
