You can then ask yourself whether your current values are the same as those you grew up with. Have you gone through a period of examination and reconsideration? Have you consciously chosen to discard some values from your upbringing and adopt new ones? Now that you have deconstructed your life and have a clear idea of what you value, you can see the values upon which you have created your life. You can see whether those values contribute to your dissatisfaction or bring you happiness. Look at which aspects of your life contribute to your unhappiness-your career, marriage, lifestyle-and ask yourself what values underlie those parts of your life.
Popular Culture and Values
A recurring theme that runs throughout my work is that inadvertently buying into the values that predominate popular culture, for
example, winning, status, power, appearance, and conspicuous consumption, is a leading cause of life dissatisfaction. The popular culture in America today-as reflected in our various media-no longer has the time,
attention span, or energy to devote to weighty and deep issues such as values. It is much easier to focus on the superficial "things" in our culture. Thus, the pursuit of wealth and material goods has become the dominant "value" in much of our society in the mistaken belief that these values will bring people happiness.
One of the most powerful ways in which this "value" was impressed on you was in
how you learned to define success. Popular culture typically defines success as winning, wealth, status, physical appearance, and popularity-the more money and power you you are, the more successful you would be. have and the more attractive and popular
Growing up with these definitions, success was largely unattainable for most people. At the same time, our culture made losing even more intolerable to contemplate- being poor, powerless, unattractive, and unpopular is simply unacceptable. With these restrictive definitions, you may have believed, like so many others, that you were caught in the untenable situation of having little opportunity for success and great chance for failure.
Blindly having accepted society's narrow definitions of success and failure takes away your power to decide how you wish to define them. By buying into popular culture's limiting definitions of success and failure rather than choosing definitions based on your own values, you can't become truly successful and

Your values form the foundation of your life. They dictate the choices you make and determine the direction that your life takes. Your values will influence decisions related to your relationships, career, and other activities you engage in. Despite this importance, few people choose their values. Instead, they simply adopt the values of their parents and the dominant values of society. In all likelihood, the values that you internalized as a child remain with you through adulthood. Unfortunately, these values may also have created a life that is carrying you down a path that is not the direction you want to go at this point in your life.
What were the values you were raised with? What values are you presently living in accordance with? Are they the same or different? Do your values bring you happiness?

To truly understand what values you possess and live by, you must deconstruct them until you are able to clearly see what exactly you value and why you hold those values. Looking openly and honestly at the way you were raised is the first step in identifying the values that you instilled growing up. What did your parents value and what values did they impress upon you-achievement, wealth, education, religion, status, independence, appearance? Think back to your childhood and ask yourself several questions: What values were emphasized in the way your parents lived their lives? What values were stressed in your family? What values were reflected in the way you were rewarded or punished? For example, were you rewarded for being highly ranked
Where do you live-do you live in a high-rise apartment in a city, in the suburbs, or in the country-and what values led you there? What activities do you engage in most-cultural, physical, religious, political, social-and what values are reflected in those activities? What do you talk about mostly-politics, religion, the economy, other people-and what does that tell you about your values?

Finally, perhaps the most telling question reflecting what you value is: What do you spend your money on-a home, cars, travel, clothing, education, art, charity? Because money is a limited resource for most people, they will use their money in ways that they value most. Over and above what people say
