## Idea 2 + Justification

- Conformity is a limiting factor for them to express themselves. This can be seen in "The sunflower canvas bag was gone. The rat was gone. The ukulele was gone. She turned around slowly for my open-mouthed, dumbstruck inspection. Nothing goofy, nothing different could I see."
