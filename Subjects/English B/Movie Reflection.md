# Movie Reflection: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse

What is the movie about? What do you like about it?

- The movie is about Miles Morales, a Spider-Man from one universe, who teams up with other Spider-People from different dimensions to stop the main villain, Spots. I really liked how it explored the idea of identity and belonging. Miles struggles to fit in with the rest of the spider-society, and this made me reflect upon myself. Most of the time I feel out of place, whether it's in class or just by myself. The movie showed that even superheroes can feel lost sometimes, and that's okay. It's comforting to see that on screen and being able to relate to Miles Morales. The idea that (spider-man) life is pre-determined with 'canon' events has similarity with real life, where people belonging to a particular community are expected to do this, achieve that, and progress through life in a structured manner. Aside from those, I like the use of creative and expressive coloring in this movie, in addition to sudden comic strips frame occasionally during action scenes.

What are the English B themes that you wish to connect with the movie? Give reasoned justification.

- One of the key themes in English B that suits the movie is "identity". Miles Morales is not just learning to be Spider-Man; he's figuring out who he is throughout the movie. Miles Morales is reluctant and denying the 'canon' event that every Spider-Man has to face, especially the death of heroic captain in his universe, who accidentally is his dad. Like Miles, the movie mirrors the journey of some teenagers to understand and accept themselves, even when it feels like the world does not understand their problems.
Another theme is "social organization". In the movie, Spider-Man from different universes come together, each with their unique styles and backgrounds. This align with English B, where we talk a lot about global perspectives and cross-cultural understanding.

What issues that you found in the movie? How would those problems present challenges to the world?

- One significant issue in the movie is the rigid adherence to predetermined events, or "canon". This mirrors the societal pressure teenagers and adolescence face to conform to traditional paths and expectations. Just as Miles is expected to follow a script for his life as Spider-Man, teenagers are often pressured into conventional roles based on their gender, academic performance, ethnic and race, or family background. This stifles the potential for development and growth in areas that matters to them the most. In a rapidly evolving world, this inflexibility can lead to a generation ill-equipped to tackle unprecedented global challenges.
Another issue is the reluctance of the Spider-Society to accept Miles fully. This exclusion reflects the ongoing struggles with inclusivity in society. Many teenagers, especially those from minority groups or those with disabilities, face rejection or are made to feel they do not belong. This exclusion discard the potential for diverse perspectives necessary for solving complex global problems.

As young people and a global citizen, what will you do to help tackle those challenges?

- As a young person and global citizen, I believe we have the power to challenge these rigid societal expectations and foster a more inclusive world. <increase tolerance to different group of people>
Next, I would leverage my tech skills for good. The internet is a powerful tool for connection and information exchange. I could join online forums that discuss these issues, maybe even start a blog about my personal journey and struggles as a teenagers and linking that to pressures teenagers face globally.
Additionally, If I were to be a prominent person in the future, I would work on building a more inclusive community. I could propose an event that celebrates diversity â€“ not just in terms of race or ethnicity, but also in interests, gender identities, and ways of thinking. We could invite speakers who've challenged societal norms and succeeded, like tech innovators who didn't follow the traditional path. By valuing each unique voice and perspective, we're not just helping individuals feel belonged; we're equipping our generation to swing into a future where everyone has the freedom to be their true selves and contribute their unique gifts to solving global challenges.
