# Indigenous Society
## Definitions

### UN Statement

~370 million indigenous people; they retain traditions, social, cultural, characteristices.
Descendant of original inhabitant.
As hunter-gatherer.

### Problems

The definitions of indigenous society is ambigous, thus **we should not define, but to identify indigenous society.** Some problems with the UN Statement include:

- Not all is hunter-gatherer.
- May not always be minority, e.g sami people.
- Non-Systematic; self-identification and reality might differ.
- Not every indigenous people are the descendants of the original inhabitants, as they have significant connection to the land.

### Discussions

Lifestyle and language, including unique traditions are what identify indigenous people, but it depends on the location or scope of the society.

## Indigenous Knowledge

Created to preserve social system and environment, limited to a particular culture of society.
These knowledges reflect the indigenous society's perspectives and range of knowledge issues.
They're transmitted across generations, through folklore, storytelling, myths, and cultural rituals.
It also sometimes correlate with agro-ecological and socio-economic environments, e.g agricultural practices, conversation, hunting, health care, and foor preparation.

Indigenous knowledge can cause conflict as they challange the modern-dominant society values,
e.g huta sialagan from batak are cannibals, eating 'criminals' they deem sinful; in their perspective, this is a ritual to sustain their society by eliminating criminals.

### Gadhimai, bloodiest festival in the world

This indigenous knowledge challanges the cultural norms and moral of the wider society.
In 2009, about 500.000 animals were killed in this festival for the sake of their goddess.

### Cultural and moral relativism

Ethical practices and moral differ among cultures; what is considered right in one culture may be wrong in another. e.g killing certain small animals (i hate ants, but some are against killing them).
