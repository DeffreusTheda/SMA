		- Argentina use Jakarta method
		- Great wealth... and corruption
			- Decrease poverty, as Per Capita GDP US 806 to US 4.114 between 1966 and 1977
			- Money under controlled by soeharto
				- The corruption is structured and well made, you need permission from Soeharto to do corruption; compared to today, you'll get backstabbed, get accused ten years later
				- Kickbacks, bast amounts skimmed from official budgets, and massive bribe revenues were paid to "charitable" foundations controlled by Soeharto (you have to to charity to be corrupt)
			- The "Cendana Family" (Because Soeharto's house is on Cendana street)
				- Granted strategic monopolies, including in cloves, toll-roads and the national car project. The family had a stranglehold on the booming economy. fx. mobil timor is the national car of Indo back then, directed by Tomy Soeharto
	- Berkeley mafia
		- Reduce the inflation rate from 600% to 1 digit only
		- Group of people who study at univ Berkeley, that emphasize the inflation in Indonesia, called by Soeharto to do this job. It worked but then the Berkeley Mafia is stopped because they use liberal method and thought to be US spy. They use capitalism to do the job. 
	- Chrony 
		- the circle of powerful people
		- Soeharto used this to get higher position in government structures, and also his family fx. promoting his family to high position in various company
	- IGGI: International monetary fund for Indonesia from Belgium, Austria, and Australia

			- We depend on foreign money for debt
		- The IMF stepped in
			- Indonesian borrowers could not service foreign currency loans and around 80 percent of listed companies and countries were soon insolvent
		- "Reformasi"
			- Soeharto once again won rigged elections in March 1998, but to no avail. Students occupied the legislative building
	- The ghost remains
		- In fact, many major political figures today were powerful under the New Order. To name just two, former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, was a New Order general, while Soeharto's former son-in-law, Prabowo Subianto allegedly abducted and tortured anti-regime activists in 1009, is now defense minister
	- New Order Romance (Young people today sees New Order rather positively)
		- For many young Indonesians who never experienced the repression of the New Order, Soeharto's rule now seems a nostalgic time of stability, security and prosperity
		- In reality, it's not
	- Sorhato era reformasi ada penjarahan, jadi satu kota ambil barang di toko-toko
		- late father, jangan ikut; semua orang bobol toko dan nyuri semua barang ygy; macet, banyak tank, barang dimana-mana
			- fx. mulia elektronik 1998, mau pulang, ada bis tingkat, ada orang becak duduh depan toko, temannya ngambil barang-barang seenaknya, taruh di becak nya, "saya tak ambil", tapi lama-lama ia terpancing ikut juga tapi kosong tinggal radio gede doang (minikompo), dia balik, becaknya hilang,

			- Economy and crony capitalism
		- Positive: 
			- Eliminate the possibility of bad/unfavored parties gaining political power;
			- The decision making and management are more straightforward because there's little possibility of disagreement from a lot of differing leaders;
			- Control and make the people more stabilized by reducing possibility of news/media that'll provoke them to riot/rebel
			- Reduced inflation rate and more controlled & focused economy
		- Negative: 
			- The government only allow 3 parties to participate in election and be voted by the peoples;
			- The minority/parties that doesn't win are having hard time to give constructive feedback/recommendation
			- Loss of expression freedom and the murder/abduction of unfavored media reporter and other similar peoples
			- The family of Soeharto freely control and lead various big organization

![[Screenshot 2023-10-08 at 15.58.52.png]]
#### ---- for example
1) Compare and contrast (give an account of the similarites and differences between two (or more) items or situations, referring to both (all) of them throughout) how two authoritarian leader (Hitler and Soeharto Era) seize the power? 
    
    Hitler once run for president election in Germany but got defeated by Hindenburg. He only got 34% of the vote, that 34% proved that he owns a significant amount of followers to him. As time passed, he was offered a counsellor position as the prime administrator in the government. He then accepted the position. one way or another, the Rein-stag governmental building was set on fire by an unknown doer, and hitler was given full authority to set [] and []. from here, he set [] the [dretarism] [mgsde] him.
    
	Soeharto on the other hand, he was chosen as president by a tragedy. Rather than hitler with election, Soeharto was handed a SUPERSEMAR letter that asks him to be the next president, as soekarno was in a tight position the the [hapreid]
	
	Both hitler and soekarno seize the power under the countries chaotic distress period. Hitler uses the loss of Germany to WW1 and the anger, grief, and guilt of the Germany people as a momentum for him to [recile] his sweet promises. He promised to undo and take account to the treaty of Versailes. He promised to make Germany back to its success era. As Hitler is very good of his speech, he obtains the people's trust and sympathy to join him and undoubtedly [de] what's being asked. It was also during the great depression where the stability of finance and mental of Germany people are still fragile, Hitler promises to diminish Jewish race, and to give back property to Germany, tackling all the inflation and injustice.
	
	Soeharto seize the government when the country is at chaos at the [asws  n] of PKI to Soekarno. Soeharto, as called the "the smiling general" is a very good at keeping his image, he retains the country by abolishing every PKI and its underbows to be gone. He gives privilege to men of the patriarchy. Women are only made to be held in the kitchen. He also initiates the three-party-rule system where the only party that could exist is only PDI, Golkar, and PPP However, with his semi-representative characteristics, the election was always rigged, that's what makes him won every election for the [ipenud]
	
	Conclusion is, Hitler's was for seizing the power is to create fear. He wants to lead a country which the people fear him so they can be obedient. However, Soeharto's way to seize is to create an image so good that the people likes him, but little did they know, he is brain-washing them into thinking [sell] actions dare by him is correct.
	
2) Analyze (break down in order to bring out the essential elements or structure. To identify pars and relationships, and to interpret informations to reach conclusions) simplification parties policies had direct impact for developing economy in new order era?  
    
    The parties that gives direct impact to economy is new order era, whether it be good or bad, first is the American educated. The Berkeley Mafia was a program conducted by transferring graduates if FEUI or Economic Faculty of University of Indonesian to be sent to the Berkeley University of California. After finishing their studies, they are sent back to Indonesia to quote unquote "develop the Indonesian economy." How ever, this was just an image depiction from the outside. The California American educated graduates are actually used as a doll to America and a corruption [dealer] in Indonesia in helping Soeharto to do so.
     
    Secondly, the REPELITA (Rencana Pembangunan Tiga Tahun) which is actually the program to develop Indonesia's prosperity and well-being. [Is started in the 1969] They are first funded by 1661. 1661 funded about the 60% of REPELITA's programs but was then dismissed because of internal conflict with [tnor Leite.] And then replaced by CGI which was under the leadership of the UN. However, it was also not enough. So, Soeharto sign as agreement and competition with IME as the funding for REPELITA and other programs. Soeharto is highly dependent on international funding which cause in a huge debt.
    
    Thirdly, the Komodo Policy in which is used to as a gift for international reputation. Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, America, etc was given a komodo to reach the "Kerja sama antar negara". Ethically, when she receive a gift they should give back to the one giving. Those countries [heng] given komodo [o] gifting Soekarno back with social and financial support, especially America, the US is very welcoming of Soeharto and is willing to agree to any regulations Soeharto made.
    
    The centralized characteristics of Soeharto also actually had direct impact to the country's economy. The country's government is made controlled so that there are less opposition and less contradictions. Soeharto called in technocrats from the foreign country to help build or plan for the development of the country. Imagine if the government is not centralized, there will be people, students, and community that oppose the idea of calling in foreign technocrats to the country.
    
3) Hitler wrote his autobiography "Mein Kampf" during in prison. Explain (Give a detailed account including reason and causes) Hitler Ideas to tackled Germany depression after got defeated in World War 1?
    
    After the Germany got defeated in WW1, the country was at great downfall. Its territory was taken over, they were demilitarized, and the army left was only 100.000. Hitler, whilst in position for overthrowing (attempt) the beer hall putsch (governmental), which down his ideas and strategies, summarized all inside Mein Kampf. Strategies written are 1st, Fuhrer. Its the [system] of a country that only has 1 supreme leader. This was needed because Hitler thinks that with a supreme  leader, there'll be no opposition and contradictions, the country will always obey and do what is being told by the supreme. Only by this strategy, that Germany will rise again, because the people have seen how democracy didn't work to German and is in need for a ideological change, they trust Hitler.
    
    2nd, Lebensraum. Only by expanding the territory of German that they will reach glory. So, Hitler took back the Rhincland that is occupied once [bc] of the Treaty of Versailes. He also take over the authority of Austria. To add, he then attacked Poland which actually initiates the WW2 to happen. To conclude, Lebensraum is the living space, the idea that to achieve glory is by expanding territory.
    
    3rd, anti-semitism. In Germany, there are no equal rights. Only by a racial hierarchy that the country will be able to survive. Aryan is considered as the most superior race and the only race that can exist. Jewish as the most lowest race, that needs to perish. Anti-semitism is an anti-Jewish idea Hitler thinks that to tackle the Germany depression, we need to abolish Jewish people as they are considered "undesirable". They are then put to "special treatment" as "[fnal] solution" of either be segregated and tortured.
    
    4th, racial superiority. Aryan race as mentioned above is the only race that could exist. Jewish needs to be perished. He even implemented a policy where women of German needs to be married with Aryan men, and give birth to as many Aryan infant as possible. If they give birth to a non-Aryan, the baby will immediately be killed.
    
    5th, communism. Communism is considered as a dangerous ideology for Germany to Hitler. Communism will create chaos and it is a contradictory to Hitler's ideology of fascism and totalitarian. Rusia is the [openly] communist and Germans [apparant]. Hitler thinks that in order to reach Germany glory, we need to take over Rusia and destroy
    
    6th, the Treaty of Versailes needs to be undo. The Treaty of Versailes brings a list of embarrassment and loss for Germany. Its territory, authority, resources in human and natural, etc. So, Hitler thinks that to make Germany back to it's prosperity, undoing the Treaty of Versailes is a must. And French, as the country who's benefitted the most from the treaty needs to be destroyed and abolished. That's what Hitler thought.
    
    Those are the six main idea of Hitler and his [paured] idea in Mein Kampf. He initiates all that strategies and executed the World War 2 but ended up in another defeat at the end.
