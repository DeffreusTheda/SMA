# Electric Field

## Definition

Potential difference -> Electron will move to area with lower potential.
Even in still and solid object, electron still moves in orbits to their nucleus, although in microscopic scale.
Not every electron movement cause electricity.

## Drift Speed

The average speed of electron when influenced by electric field, typically $10^{-4} m s^{-1}$ or $1 mm s^{-1}$; Speed at which ions move along the conductor is known as the drift speed.
The speed of electric field is close to the speed of light.
The current is directly related to the rate at which ions move.
The diamater of a pipe flowing with electron (but not a fluid irl) is inversely proportional with the speed of the electron movement.

$I = \frac{Q}{\delta t} = n \cdot A \cdot v \cdot \delta t \cdot e$
$v = \frac{I}{n \cdot A \cdot e}$

In the diagram, the current trough the $1.0 mm$ diamater part of the wire is $1.2 A$ and the drift speed is $2.2 \cdot 10^{-4} m s^{-1}$.
Calculate:

- the current in $2.0 mm$ diamater.
  - still $1.2 A$

- the drift speed in the part of the wire with $2.0 mm$ diamater.
  - $v_2 = \frac{v_1 * r_1^2}{r_2^2}$
  - $v_2 = \frac{2.2E-4 m s^{-1} \cdot (0.5E-3 m)^2}{(1.0E-3 m)^2}$
  - $v_2 = \frac{2.2E-4 m s^{-1} \cdot 0.25E-6 m}{1.0E-6 m}$
  - $v_2 = 5.5E-5 m s^{-1}$

Copper has a molar mass $63.5 g mole^{-1}$ and density $8960 kg m^{-3}$.

- Calculate the volume of 1 mole of copper.
  - $V = \frac{m}{P}$
  - $V = \frac{6.35E-3 kg}{8960 kg m^{-3}}$
  - $V = 7.08705357E-7 m^3$

- If each atom of copper contributes 1 free electron, calculate the number of free electrons per unit volume of copper.
  - $n = \frac{\sum e}{V}$
  - $n = \frac{6.02E+23}{7.09E-6}$
  - $n = 8.5E+28$

- Calculate the drift velocity of electrons along a 1 mm diameter copper wire carrying a current of 1 A.
  - $v = \frac{I}{n \cdot A \cdot e}$
  - $v = \frac{1 A}{8.5E+28 \cdot (\phi \cdot (0.5E-4 m)^2) \cdot 1.6E-19}$
  - $v = 9.36E-5 m s^{-1}$
