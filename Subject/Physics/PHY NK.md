- (a) The students vary V and measure the time T for the ball to move once from one plate to the other. The table shows some of the data.
		V / kV T / s ± 0.1s
		3.00 1.4
		5.00 0.8
		7.00 0.6
		(i) V is provided by two identical power supplies connected in series. The potential difference of each of the power supplies is known with an uncertainty of 0.01kV. 
		State the uncertainty in the potential difference V.
	- (1.4 - 0.6)/2 = 0.4kV

	- Learning objectives
		- Distinguish between vector and scalars
	- Vector
		- Some quantities in physics, such as time, distance, mass ,speed and temperature, just need one number to specify them. These are called scalar quantities. For example, it is sufficient to say that the mass of a
