1. Determine a value for the average speed of nitrogen molecules at normal air pressure ($1.0E+5~P_a$) if a mass of $1.4~g$ of the gas was in a container of volume $1200~cm^3$.

   - 

2. How many moles of nitrogen were in the container (see Table B3.1)?

   - $n = \frac{m}{mr} = \frac{1.4\~g}{28} = 5E-2\~mol$

3. Calculate the temperature of the gas.

   -

4. Determine a value for the average molecular speed if the temperature rose to $350~K$ in the same container.

   - $m_p = \frac{m}{N}$
   - $\frac{\frac{1}{2} \cdot m \cdot v^2}{N} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot kT$
   - $\frac{1}{2} \cdot m_p \cdot v_p^2 = \frac{3}{2} \cdot kT$
   - $\frac{1}{2} \cdot m \cdot v^2 = \frac{3}{2} \cdot N \cdot kT$
   - $m \cdot v^2 = 3 \cdot n \cdot N_A \cdot kT$
   - $v = 560~ms^{-1}$

A hot air balloon works because the density of hot air is less than the surrounding cold air.

1. The volume of a hot air balloon is $2500\~m^3$ and its mass is $250\~kg$ (without passengers). The temperature of the air in the balloon is $100\~\degree C$. Density of air at $20\~\degree C = 1.21\~kgm^3$. Average relative molecular mass of air = $29\~g\~mol^{-1}$

   1. Calculate the volume of $1\~kg$ of at $20\~\degree C$. (2)

      - $\frac{v_1}{T_1} = \frac{v_2}{T_2}$
      - $v = \frac{m}{p} = \frac{1}{1.21}$
      - $v = 0.826\~m^3$

   2. Calculate the volume of 1 kg of air at 100 Â°C and hence show that the density of air at $100\~degree C$ is $0.95\~kgm^3$. (3)

      - $\frac{0.8264\~m^3}{293\~K} = \frac{v_2}{373\~K}$
      - $v_2 = 1.01\~m^3$
      - $p = \frac{m}{v} = \frac{1}{1.01} = 0.95\~kgm^{-3}$

   3. Calculate the mass of hot air in the balloon. (1)

      -

   4. Calculate the mass of cold air displaced by the balloon. (1)

      - 

   5. Determine whether the balloon will leave the ground or not. (2)
  
      -

2. continued...
