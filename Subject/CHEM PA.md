- Hormones is fat
- Brain is actually a bunch of fat that bond together, sending chemicals to the protein bonded organs
- Proton + neutron + electron came after the solid sphere theory
- Dalton research is the solid sphere model
- You can break science law if you have evidence
- Democritus -> John Dalton -> Thomson -> Rutherford
- Plum Pudding
- Why atom's sphere? because sphere is the most balanced shape possible; *the best shape that can imagined is sphere*
- Atoms in space? matters is something that has mass and takes space
- The new nuclear model stated that the electron move in centripetal movement
- Why called atom: nuclear model? because it have nucleus in it

- Excited: changing orbit one state above
- n=3 higher (Excited); n=2 ground; lower (Ground)
- The nucleuss of an atom is actually about 100,000 times smaller than the overall size of the atom
- In perspective, if we imagine an atom were the size of a stadium, the nucleus would be smaller than a grain a sand
- Proton and Neutron have mass; While electron has a very small amount, it doesn't effect atomic or mass number
- Atoms made up of three types of subatomic particles: proton, neutron, and electron
- Two properties of protons, neutrons and electrons: mass and electrical charge; proton mass=1 and charge++, neutron mass=1 and no charge; electron mass=~0 and charge--
- Isotope: two or more atoms with the same atomic number but the mass number is different
- Ar (Atomic relative mass): 
	- (%Atom x mass number)1 + (%Atom x mass number)2 / 100%
	- Average mass of the isotopes
	- Mostly found in external assessment
- How to know the percentage of mass? from the analytics; mass spectrophotometer 
- Isotopes occur because fission reaction of something to produce element(s)
- Neutrons count = mass number - atomic numbers
- Why is it called atomic number? it's actually also called proton number
- Radioactive decays: process of long-time (billions years) decaying of some elements with the least amount of atomic mass; can produce other element; mass always decrease

- Atomic relative
	- Omg why is the internet lagging 07.06
	- A proton? is a positively charged thing of atom
	- Atomic mass? the weight of the atom from the neutron+proton
	- Atomic number? from the amount of proton
	- Isotope? == atomicNumber, != atomicMass
	- *No, I don't understand atomic configuration*
	- The Mass Spectrometer? apparatus for determine the percentage abundance of atom
		- The sample is element, for example:
			- A, we can't detect the neutron, so we make it an ion, negative or positively charged, if the atom is located in left of periodic table they'll be positive G1-13 -- G14 it's depend, it consist of 3 types of element, those element that have metal properties will have positive charge, semi metal == positive/negative depend on the element , while the rightmost, non-metal elements is negatively charged - god why is it lagging
		- Elements in middle of periodic table is transitional, 
		- Ion is an element that release or gaining electron
			- Why must be electron? Because electron located in the outer shell of the nucleus + easy to release/gain
			- Losing electron == positively charged, and the opposite
		- Mass spectrometer
			- Order of how it works
				- Liquid sample -> make the element in gas form -> after we have gas of element, it's easier to be ionized
				- Ionisation area turn things to ion -/+
				- Ion accelerated
				- vacuum chamber maintain the movement of the ion so we can detect the mass of the ion
				- Detected by the ion detector
				- Then we get this mass spectrum graph
			- ![[Pasted image 20230807072717.png]]
			- You only need to put the sample to one of the bundle, then just set up the device and then it'll automatically do the job and give you the result - I'm tired
			- How do we get the atom mass? *At* = averageMassOfIsotopesOfTheElement **/** 1/12*massOf1AtomOfCarbon12
				- Note: 1/12 of the mass of one carbon12 atom = 1 amu
				- Why 1/12? because carbon12 is the highest percentage element in nature, around ~90% or so - It's close to the hundred percent pure compared to other elements so it became the standard
				- Why 12? because it is the atomicMass of carbon12
				- The bottom part of the formula is always 1/12 * 12 to convert it to amu unit, mostly it's for formality
				- Example:
					- (Indium113 85%, Indium115 15%)
						- At = 113.3 / (1/12 * 12 amu) = 113.3 amu
					- (X63 69%, X67 31%)
						- At = ? / (1/12 * 12 amu) = ? amu
	- Emission Spectra
		- The range of wavelength - electromagnetic spectra
		- Can be divided into 3 spectrum
			- Continuous
				- All the wavelength emitted by light-source
			- Emission
				- By glowing gasses - Electron move from higher to lower energy level
			- Absorption
				- Electron move from lower to higher energy level
		- Why Aurora borealis is mostly green? What actually happening in the atmosphere?  It's because of the oxygen
			- What's the most abundance gas? Oxygen + Hydrogen
			- It's happens often in the arctic - The percentage of oxygen is concentrated in north and south pole
			- The sun: 
				- Release continuous spectra
				- Hydrogen(Main, do fusion & reaction to produce Helium) + Helium(Release a lot of energy)
				- The results will affect the atmosphere
				- In the pole the energy is high and oxygen is high - nucleus+electron because of this energy it will absorb - it will detect as absorbing spectra, creating
# 2023-08-08
- The sun releases photons/light - **continuous spectra**, since the amount of o2 is abundant in north pole, this o2 will gain the energy fro the sun so the electron go to the higher level energy - **absorption spectra**. Why? because the only suitable wavelength is photon
- When the electron return to lower level energy, it will release energy - which produce **emission spectra**
- Higher state of spectra? in configuration, there's higher and lower level energy that electron orbits in - from the closest to farthest to the nucleus -- the lowest orbitals 0EV (Zero Electron volt), lowest energy level -- next orbital/shell, 0.8EV - 1.2EV - 12.5EV -- if the distance is close, it will have lower energy level -- excitation is the moving of an electron from a energy level to the other
- Sub-shell -- s p d f, from lowest to highest
- What cause the movement of electron? Because always have energy that's similar to the energy level they're in -- to handle instability when the electron change the amount of energy it hold -- electron have potential and kinetic energy -- the energy they got from the outside is kinetic and the original is the potential
- Types of spectra
	- Continuous: produced by solids, liquids & dense gases -- no gaps in wavelength
		- Hot dense energy sources
	- Emission: produced by low density  & rarefied gases -- only in narrow wavelength regions
		- From how low density cloud of gasses
		- Different element give different color in the spectra
	- Absorption: Gas atoms absorb the same wavelength as they usually emits and result Absorption line spectrum
		- Hot/Dense energy source --> cooler low density gasses == the element in gas form
		- From continuous to absorption
	- The absorption and emission will be different in its element because its atom have differ energy, so that's why the visualization can be different -- not always the same
	- We can know the energy level of shells in the atom from the emission spectra
	- Absorption spectra shows excess of energy that absorbed by the atom
	- The higher the energy level, the bigger the gap between emission in emission spectrum
- Line spectra
	- Is build of the emission spectra
	- Having different pattern for each element because different energy level
	- Example: My clothes is gray, but the atoms absorbing the other color than gray; white would mean it emit all the color; black absorb all color -- so that's why black color shirts is usually hotter than white color shirt
	- Black mask absorb all wavelength, giving the skin heat, after that it will cause temp to rise and make your face oily, causing acne
	- Is the atomic number have any correlation with the number of the lines in the line spectrum?
- Model proposed by Niels Bohr 1913
	- An atom consists of a small, dense nucleus (containing protons and neutron) surrounded by electron, which he theorized after
	- Atom model always developing -- you can make your own theory, if its used by many researchers then it'll be the new theory
	- Each atom shell have different energy level -- n=1 is the lowest, and the opposite -- lower energy is more stable, and the opposite apply
	- Example: 
		- Hydrogen: 1 proton in nucleus, 1 electron in n=1 -- this is why it's the first in periodic table
	- Atoms always find a way to stabilize themselves -- all elements we found in the nature is already stable -- stabilizing can be done in many ways
	- Element's period can be known from the row it is in the periodic table -- the period is based on the number of the shells an atom has
	- Number of electron in outermost shell will give information about the group they're in -- in the old periodic table is divided by group A and B, B is the transitional elements while A is the rest -- the current periodic table is using sub-shells, which make it 18 column --
	- Why is *19*K = 2 8 8 1 and not 2 8 9? because of sub-shells (S2 P6 D10 F14) -- if the atom lower energy it only uses S and P which is summed as 8 (I don't understand)
- Correlation of bo when electron in shell want to move they have to release/gain energy -- 
- How to calculate energy
	- E = *hv'*
	- E = h/lambda
	- V = 1/lambda
	- 1/lambda = Rh(1/n.f.squared - 1/n.i.squared)
	- E = h * Rh(1/n.f.squared - 1/n.i.squared)
	- Rh is an constant

# 2023-08-14
- Emission spectra? because of higher to lower energy level electro movement
- Absorption spectra? opposite of emission spectra
- Every atom have shells, not all these will be filled with electron
- If the electron move around second shell it's called lyman series; balmer series; paschen series, foe each level
- emission of radiation by atoms
	- EY' = hV' = E2 - E1
	- E = h . v
	  E = h/wavelength
		- E is energy
		- h is plank constant --- _6.626 x 10-34 J/s
	- the first one is spontaneous emission; the electron is unstable from it's own energy so when they want to min their energy so they release/emission spectra
	- stimulated emission happen when electron stable but a energy from outside hit them and make it higher energy and unstable --- then it'll release energy to stabilize
- atomic spectrum
	- if the gap between line is closer, the wavelength is lower/decrease
	- Line separation converges at a particular wavelength, called the series limit.
	- Balmer found that the wavelength of the lines could be written: 
	- How to calculate atomic spectrum
		- 1/wavelength = Rh(1/xSquared - 1/nSquared)
			- N = integer
			- X what the shell
			- for 2nd shell
			- Rydberg constant: 1.097 x 10(toThePowerOf7) m(toThePowerOf-1)
		- example: 5 -> 1
- Other series of hydrogen:
	- Lyman; UV; n_f_ = 1, n_1_ greaterThanOrEqualTo 2
	- Balmer; Visible/UV; n_f_ = 2, n_1_ greaterThanOrEqualTo 3
	- Balmer; IR; n_f_ = 3, n_1_ greaterThanOrEqualTo 4
	- Balmer; IR; n_f_ = 4, n_1_ greaterThanOrEqualTo 5
	- Balmer; IR; n_f_ = 5, n_1_ greaterThanOrEqualTo 6
- Grotrian diagram
	- shows the limit series in atoms (mostly hydrogen)
	- spectral lines can be considered as transition between terms
	- transitions only occur between certain terms. Called selection rule, it's triangle.n = 1, 2, 3, ...
- How is the PTable arranged?
	- Number of shells will dictate an atom's period (row)
	- Group (column) say the electron in outer shell determines an atom
- S2 P6 D10 F14
- Why is it 2, 8, ***8***?
	- Because it's more stable than 18
	- We're only allowed to wrote 2, 8, ***8***, 18, ***18***, 32
	- 4S2 < 3D10 < 4P6
	- Each shell have as many sub-shells as its level
		- In the fourth shells, 4S2 < 3D10 < 4P6
- Exercise: 
	- 35.Bromin (Br)

- 19K : 1s1 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s1 (Group: 1; Period 4)
- Each pair of electron form a "room" in the sub-shell
	- You have to fill every room by one electron before giving it another electron

	- There's no H2 because H1 is incomplete/unstable - there always hydrogen in helium this is why link called H - H basically all element stabilize themselves, for example by chemical bonding
	- 25Mn [Ar] 4s2 3d5
		- 25 Mn+? = 24 = must follow full principle = [Ar] 4s1 3d5
			- In this one, the outer most shell is 4s1

particulate of matter in next meeting -- present the discussion
29 Cuper have different configuration, it must follow full-principle; 24 Chromium must follow the half full principle; other than thewe two, it'll be just like normal
if there's a question that doesn't specify you to write condensed/complete configuration, you're allowed to write condensed
If an element is unstable, they'll merge with other element to stabilize
# 2023-08-28
### Models of the particulate nature of matter
- [ ] Tasks: presentation or discuss, give us explanation of what you already known of this topic
- What is matter? Something that have mass and occupy space
	- solid/gas/liquid; made of atoms; fill the empty space; they all have mass; occupy space; 
	- why smoke and visible particles is considered matter? Because they occupy space and they have a mass even if it's tiny
- element, substances (Gold ore), compounds (Gold chloride), and mixture (Product made of gold among other things)
- Octet rule: outer most shell must have 8 to be stabile
- Atom:
	- just one sodium
- Elements, consider the octet rule
	- O2: O = O (Double bond is to stabilize their conf. because oxygen have to follow an octet rule "Outer most shell must be eight; Oxygen has 6 electron, so to stabilize they use double bond")
	- N2: N __=-__ N (Because they have one type of chemical bonds)
	- H2 (because having similar atoms and same type of bonding)
	- More than one sodium, in different shape (because they  have similar atoms)
	- Just the one carbon in the carbohydrate structure
- Compound: consist of atoms of different elements chemically bonded together in a fixed ratio; made of two different atoms
	- carbohydrate (have many type of atoms)
	- Ionic: metal - non (gold chloride)
	- Covalent: non - non (O3: O = O - O)
	- Metal: metal - metal
	- H2O (made from one type of bond)
	- Coral: mostly made of CaCO3 (Calcium carbonate: if we heat it, it will produce CaO (Calcium oxide) + CO2 (Carbon dioxide)) -- limestone
	- CO2
	- CaO
	- CaCO3
- Substances: has a definite and constant composition; groups of molecules; impure conditions (it must be of 100% purity, it's better to call something compound than substance unless in specific cases); the definition is general, can be used for almost anything tangible.
	- O2 (because it align with the definition of substance)
	- a bottle of NaCl
	- a bottle of H2O (because it align with the definition)
- Molecules: many atoms of the same type; tiniest part of substance or compound
- Mixtures: contain **more than one element** or compound in **no fixed ratio**, which are **not chemically bonded** and so **can be separated by physical methods** (because it's not only made of one type of thing) -- heterogenous/homogenous
	- your desk (not just wood)
	- coins
	- product made of mostly gold
	- milk
	- paint
	- sea water (homogenous mixture, because the have salt ya know)

- Triple bond exist

- Alfin, Tristan, Jasmine, Keyzahra, Nora, Sora, Farrel, Aretha
- Subgroup
	- Melting
	- Freezing
	- Vaporization (Evaporation and boiling)
	- Condensation
	- Sublimation
	- Deposition

# 2023-09-03
- Emission spectra: infrared / visible / ultraviolet:
	- Ascending()
		- N = 1 : Infrared (low energy)
		- N = 2 : Visible
		- N = 3
		- N = 4
		- N = 5 -> Ultraviolet (high energy)
	- If energy is lower, wavelength will he higher

	- 1/𝝺 
- From higher to lower energy

# 2023-09-11
- The naming of elements back then can be determined by the region it's found or the researcher that found the element.
- Newlands (Octave): based on the atomic weight, ordered like octave
	- Atomic weight 1-7 is already found so their properties is quite similar with octave(7)
	- how about atomic weight higher than 7? put them along with the octave: fx. atomic weight 1 & 8 & 15 is in the same row
- Meyer (table)
	- Based on weight and properties
- Mendeleev (Table) : completed the Meyer table
	- Similar with modern pTable
- Reyleigh - Ramsey (Noble gasses): noble because it's stable
	- found helium neon argon krypton xenon radon to be stable in room temperature -- won't react with other elements
- Mosely (Table): arranged all the found elements -- similar with modern pTable put didn't put Actinide and Lathanide yet
	- Main group (1 & 2, 13 - 18) and transition group (3 - 12)
- Seaborg (Lanthanide & Actinide)
	- They have nuclear properties -- used for generating nuclear energy
	- Most common used is uranium
- S P D F: 
	- color
		- Green is non-metal (can be found in 3 states)
		- Pink is semi metal
		- Yellow is metal, always solid
		- Blue is transition metal (mostly liquid)
		- White = radioactive (elements with 'uu' in their name means that they don't have name yet)
			- fx. Nihonium(113) was called uut(113)
	- 1S1 || 1S2 : The element that have the outer most shell being S will be in the first row of pTable
	- 3S3P : In the period 3, group 13-18
	- 3D 4S : transition group, 4th period
	- 3D is the 4th period of transition group
	- **S is in the first and second group; P is in the 13-18 group; D is the transition group; F is the Lathanide and Actinide (the separated table below the big table one)**
	- Fx. practice
		- X[Ar]4S2 3D8 = 4th period, group 10 (from 2 + 8)
		- X[Ar]4S2 3D10 4P5 = 4th period, group 17 (2 + 10 + 5)
	- each group have their own nickname, like Lathanide and Actinide
		- [ ] search what they are

## Chemical Bonding
This material will mostly appear in [inaudible] exams
Chemical properties is related to the transferring electron, or almost anything to do with electron.
Divided into 2 type of bonding:
### Intramolecular
The chemistry **bonding happen inside the molecule**; the bond **between the atoms in molecule**
for example: Na & Cl in NaCl
It's further divide into 3 category:
- **Ionic**: **metal + non-metal**; they will **transfer electron**, from metal to non-metal
	- **electrostatic attraction**: for example: 
		- Na (metal) + Cl (non-metal) --> Na+ + Cl- = NaCl, where Na (becoming cation) release an electron and Cl (becoming anion) gaining one electron, thus creating a bond by closing in because they have different charges, creating electrostatic attraction
		- Mg (metal) + O (non-metal) --> Mg2+ + O2- --> MgO, explanation the same as previous, but in this case because of their group, they transfer 2 electron
		- Mg (metal) + 2CL (non-metal) --> Mg2+ + 2Cl- --> MgCl2, thus we can conclude that the release and gaining of electron(s) must be the same in molecules
- **Covalent**: **non-metal + non-metal**; they can't gain or release electron, but they share it and use it together
- **Metallic**: **metal + metal**; As metals tend to release electrons, thus this bonding will release the electrons, creating *sea of electron*, with electron acting as *glue*
Metal tend to release electron, with non-metal being the opposite; when a atom gain/release electron, it become an ion
## Intermolecular
There can be more than one intermolecular bonding between molecules
In contrast to Intramolecular bonding, intermolecular <!--Chemistry--> **bonding  happen between molecules**; because of the interactions between molecules
for example: salt that dissolve in water
Differentiating non-polar and polar molecules: non-polar is atom that have doesn't have two opposing poles, while polar is like magnet - having negative side and positive side in the opposite direction;
Divided into 3 category:
- **Dipole-dipole**: di means two, pole means pole; between polar and non-polar; interaction between molecules that have two poles; one of them is the positive, while the other is negativity; atoms that have low electronegativity will release positive dipole, with the opposite for atoms with high electronegativity; **similar to magnet**, in other words it is an bond that happen with an atom with a low electronegativity and a high electronegativity; dipole positive is the atoms that have low electronegativity, and the opposite for dipole negative; **between polar and non-polar molecules**; Temporary dipole happen when non-dipole met with dipole molecules, whereas permanent dipole bonding happen between dipole and dipole molecules
- **Hydrogen bonding**: interaction of hydrogen with atoms that have high electronegativity; not all hydrogen atom can do the hydrogen bond, only hydrogen that bound with the electronegativity (for example: O, N, F);
	- for example: interaction between water, a hydrogen can bond to other oxygen from another water molecules; hydrogen that bond two high electronegativity element
- **Van der waals / London forces**: always **happen in non-polar with non-polar** (organic molecules); also can be found in polar molecules, basically all molecules, they always have van der waals - if one of the molecule is non-polar, then there's van der waals bonding in it; 
# 2023-10-24
- Na & Cl forms salt (NaCl), by ionic bond, and their chemical properties change - from toxic & poisonous respectively into a *less* toxic molecules of NaCl; 11Na + 17Cl --> 10Na + 18Cl --> NaCl //Stable++,Na.radius--,Cl.radius++,Na.radius>Cl.radius\==true;
- Chemical bonding is one of the way for elements to stabilize themselves; not every bonding is possible as it need sufficient energy
- **how do atoms form ions?**
	- an ion atoms or group of atoms that has an electrical charge, either positive and negative; release 2 electrons thus it'll became 2+, gaining 3 electrons thus it'll became 3-;
- PRACTICE
