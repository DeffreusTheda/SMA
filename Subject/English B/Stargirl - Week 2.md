Hello I'm alfin from Ten five, and today i'm gonna recap week 2 of reading stargirl by answering a few questions.
1. Briefly retell the stories from the chapters that you have read, what is it about?
	
	So i'm will retell the story, from chapter 21 to chapter 27. 
	
	So, in chapter 12 and 13, the story talk about how the *'Hot Seat'* show with Stargirl went horrible that makes the production team decided to never air it. 
	In chapter 13, the Mica Area High school is losing in the basketball games, but Stargirl's unbreakable positivity and support to the enemy team made the students sick of her and blamed her for their losses.
	Then, Leo Borlock started his romantic relationship with Stargirl in chapters 14, where he receive a valentine letter from her. 
	He and Stargirl began to spend time together, they meditate, bicycling together, sending gifts and cards, learn about the people around them, and so on. Unlike Leo's expectation, Stargirl's house is surprisingly normal.
	They even kissed together during the —quote unquote the— 'happiest moments in Stargirl's life'. 
	But outside of this relationship, Leo became excluded and avoided by the student body just like Stargirl. 
	And not being able to accept that, Leo began to avoid stargirl until he decided to have conversations with Stargirl to make her understand.
	And it works, she changed into a normal looking person, into Susan, who's optimist that she can win the state oratorical contest.
	And that's up to chapter 27, on to the next question.

2. What are the conflicts that happened in the story? What are the resolution?
	So as a said before, Leo's is having a dilemma to choose between Stargirl and his friends.  
	and He resolve the problem by persuading Stargirl into a better person in his view, which is to be more normal so that they can blend in with the student body. 
	
	Aa for Stargirl, she is excluded and hated by the student body for being a very different person. And for this, she just simply didn't care and continue to be herself, giving the best of herself, no matter what others say about her.

3. What do you think about Stargirl's behaviour so far?
	I admit that I feel more annoyed reading about Stargirl's behaviour as the story went on. She is extraordinarily goofy and cheerful, which is... like unbearable to some. This contrast difference with normal people is the main reason why Stargirl became infamous and avoided from the student body. She may be passionate and kind, but her ingrained characteristics of being corny still bother people around her, even Leo. 

4. Please connect the story with the themes that we have in English B!
	So the theme that is the most fitting for this story is I think the theme of identity. Because, Stargirl is a unique and she stand out the most from the crowd, which makes her hard to tolerate her and be comfortable around with her. Disregarding that, Stargirl still acts as Stargirl, being herself, as a caring and kind girl, helping anyone no matter who they are, even if they hate and mock her. She doesn't let people influence what she is and she doesn't care to make herself to satisfy what other people wants or able to accept. She is a reminder for us to be the best of ourself, no matter what other people thinks.

So I think that's all from me for today. See you again in Week 3. Good bye.
