Hello there, my name is Muhammad Alfin Azza Pujaar and I'm from the class X5. Today, will be answering a question which is

What's my first impression on the book Stargirl?

Okay, so, Stargirl is a young girl, she is authentic and different from anyone else in the Mica Area High Schools, which is the school that she went into after 15 years of homeschooling. 

Stargirl contrast to her peers. 

She can be immediately recognizable with her unique and long dresses. 

She's a kind and caring person, and she doesn't differentiate anybody whenever she help. 

Somehow, she know a lot about most people in her surrounding even if they never met her before. 

Although she is shunned and avoided by the student body, that doesn't stop her from playing her self-made birthday song with her ukulele to celebrate any student's birthday. 

Not only that, she always left a gift on the desk of her fellow students on important dates, like thanksgiving.

Okay, so, a brief summary of the 26 chapters I've read, the story start to build up, when she show up uninvited in a football game in her school, showing herself dancing during the marching band performance. 

Stargirl's acrobatic performance attracted many attentions, including the cheerleaders on the spot. 

This make her invited to the cheerleader team, and she agreed. 

Although much further in to the story, her corniness and the fact that she even cheered when the enemy team scored points, it made her hated by the student body. 

But she didn't seems to care. 

And yeah, now I'll introduce the story's first person view character, Leo Borlock. 

He is the producer of the school's famous *Hot Seat* show, which invite honored kids to be interviewed. 

They're interested to invite Stargirl to be on the *Hot Seat*, and surprisingly she agrees. 

This results in both the most disastrous and the best *Hot Seat* show ever done, although the juries ruin it by taking out their anger on Stargirl, and thus causing it to never be released.

And so, starting from chapter 14, the story become more invested into the growing love between Stargirl and Leo Borlock. 

In the narration of Leo, the world became just for the two of them. 

They spent time together: going out, bicycling together, learning about anyone around them, meditating in the sunset, and enjoying time together to a degree that Leo has never felt before. 

But, there is a cost for this wonderful relationship, is that Leo became shunned and excluded by the student body too, just like Stargirl. 

This make Leo uncomfortable and thus he try to revert things back as it was. He and Stargirl had conversations spanning multiple days about this. 

Leo tell Stargirl that she is just undesirable different and ask her to realize the situation. 

Surprisingly in the next day, Leo Borlock found out that Stargirl is not here anymore, and she was replaced with Susan. 

Susan, previously known as Stargirl, won the Arizona state oratorical contest, and next she's going to the state contest. 

Unlike Stargirl, Susan dressed the same as other students in the school, and this make Leo incredibly happy. 

Okay, so that's my initial impression on the book Stargirl. 

Currently I've only read 26 chapter of the book, and my expectation is... that Leo and Stargirl might have a breakup. 

And I think that's all, so, alright see you.
