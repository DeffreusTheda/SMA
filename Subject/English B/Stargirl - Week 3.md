By the end of this week, you should finish reading the novel. As the final progress check, please answer the following questions in a 5-10 minutes video.

Hello everyone, let me introduce myself, my name is Muhammad Alfin Azza Pujaar from the class of X5, and today I will be recapping my week 3 of reading Stargirl, by answering four questions.

1. What do you think about the ending of the story?
   I feel like this ending is quite melancholy. 
   Stargirl just leave out of the town without any notice, leaving many questions unanswered and many people feeling they have lost something.
   The Leo Borlock's class has been having a reunion every five years after they graduated, although he never come to the reunion.
   As said by Kevin, Leo knew that even till now, they're still talking about Stargirl.
   - from Leo's observation, he noticed many things that relate with Stargirl after her departure:
	   - and many others act of kindness sprouting all over Arizona, that is similar to what Stargirl did back then.
   this show her impact and influence when she was still here.
   I think this ending is quite open to interpretation and leave rooms for imagination for the readers.

2. What is the most interesting part of the story? Give examples and reasons.
   So,
   I think the most fascinating part of the story is when Stargirl try to suit in with the student body and tries to act normal like everyone else.
   - It started when Stargirl came back from the state oratorical competition
   - she expected the whole school to celebrate her achievement, but she only see Dori Dilson hiding herself behind a congratulations sign. This make Stargirl disappointed, and struck, so shocked that she can't say any word.
   - After that event, She stopped trying to be normal.
   - She now dress up like she was before, and did things as she did back then.
   - she created a little band called Ukee Dooks, which only Dori Dilson applied for that. They play songs together so well, except that the student ignored them no matter what they do. Seeing this, Leo feel sorry for her but decided not to interfene or interact with her again.
  
  And this part show the writer's message that he is giving for us, which I will discuss more in question number 4.
  on to the third question:

3. What are the Anglophone cultures that you found in the book? Mention at least 3 points and give detailed explanation for each idea that you mention.
   So starting from the first one,:
	- Conformity, in the US, the students are taught the same things no matter who they're, so this create a place where everyone is expected to be the same, with little differences between each other, all having the same identity as a student of a certain school.
	- Intolerant, people in the US, they're less tolerant to differences, they don't like people that is different from them, they're not comfortable with that as they think everyone should be just similar to them.
	- Identity, or maybe should I say, ethnocentrism, as shown when the Mica Area High School's basketball team is competing in a tournament. They're so excited and moved by the uprising of their team's success, and they hated it when the enemy team show any sign of success. This explain why Stargirl is hated too because she is cheering anyone, including the enemy team when they score points.
	so that's the three anglophone culture that i found, so that's for question 3, and question 4....

4. What is the most important value from the story?
    I think the most important value of the story is for us to be brave being ourself. We shouldn't let other people's thought, opinion, words, and mocking halt us from being ourself. 
    I think that happyness come from ourself and not from others. This is reflected well with the characters of Stargirl, where she doesn't care about what other people think about her, she will always do what she like, being kind, showing herself off, dancing, and all of that.

so i think that's all for the week 3 recap, soo goodbye.
