Impression:
While I reading this I reminded back the many things that I did, just to make me feel special, mostly in my school life. Most of it is from the Elementary, small there is for junior high school. I don't know how to articulate this though precisely to you all. I feel like Stargirl is something I wanted to become of back then: special, different. I remember the feeling of hatred when my teachers disapprove me for doing something I like, even if it's just a variation of something they're teaching -- I don't follow the directions precisely as they wanted to.
