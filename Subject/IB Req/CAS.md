I relish being able to accomplish specific tasks or objectives such as quests in video games. I feel most proud of myself whenever Iâ€™m performing much better than the average person, and also breaking a new and well-deserved personal best. When I was a little boy, I teach myself how to activate and implement cheats to modify the events in Nintendo 64 games to my heart's content. This is the very first thing that introduced me to coding and binary language.

This wish and desire to control the video games I played is what motivated me to start in the field of game modding, mostly on the RTS video game Starcraft: Brood War and Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty. When I was starting, I only could use the palette there to simply add or remove terrain and characters. Later on, I started to be able to modify the value and the mechanics of the abilities or power, implementing scripted events and objectives, and even creating my own original characters. Although I never published any of my works, this hobby has nurtured an arousing desire in me to be a game developer.
