How we get the knowledge:
- books or other sources; 
- from experience;

In TOK: 
- How do we know what we claim to know; where do we get the definition of something;
- Perspectives: Discussing different perspectives, respect them all; no wrong or right in perspective; have good understanding before you speak of something;
- Methods and Tools: How we acquire the knowledge;
- Ethics: Which knowledge to share or not; Proven or not yet, you need to know it
- Knowledge and Religion: 
Term: Knower

There'll 55 proms to be answered in TOK exhibition, you can only choose one
3-5 months to complete essay after getting the essay; there'll be 6 title, choose one
TOK exhibition in the end of the first year

Advantage of TOK in everyday life: 
be open minded; we'll know which info is useful or not; open new perspectives and deepen knowledge about something; how things work; we can analyze knowledge itself, train us how to think critically and differentiate hoax or truth; we can criticize something and get an solution to improve it; 

You learn something from not just one source; don't be ignorant;

difference between TOK and philosophy:
- TOK is understanding, dealing with the knowledge
- Philosophy is about questioning the universe




Interpretation: analyze facts and figure out what could be make of them. the more facts there is the more convincing the interpretation it is. Interpretation could also means perspective. However, the facts available may not be all the relevant facts to conclude an interpretation. I don't know what I'm talking about. Interpretation is like an image of something based on the available facts. Interpreter need to know why is the facts like that. You need to evaluate the various interpretations of something, check it's accuracy, is the facts relevant, and judging the validity of the facts given. 
	You will need to choose the facts to give evidence to support the answer. Interpret the facts significances to te po

- democracy; the facts; interpretation of facts
- "democracy is the best form of government."
	- Evidence:
		- because the decision is made by the majority; people can choose their ruler; it's ensure freedom and rights for the people; 
		- By the 2002, around 65% of the government use at least partially democratic. This is because democracy is the most viable tool for public freedom as they're the one who control the decision
		- Other forms of government tend to exploit others, as the citizens have no control over the government; Leaders can do freely what they want, unlike democracy
		- While the majority is the one that hold the power, there is some modification of democracy that also care about the minority. They'll assign representative from each major group so the government does not revolve around one particular party of power.

	- Critics:
		- Some said that democracy is just the tyranny of the majority as the minorities doesn't have much influence. They say that is it not justice and rights but because of superior force of the majority
			- This is a legitimate criticism, as there has been record of side-lining the minority in the history of democracy
		- It only need just more than 50% of the vote to dictate the decision; This means it only need enough people to decide the outcome, which is not always "majority" but only half of it.
		- The government is forced to carry out the will of the people, but their decision are sometimes fickle and unwise. In other government where one better educated, informed, and wiser leader than the population rules the government, this kind of problem wouldn't happen.

- Certainty
	- Knowledge that has been established beyond any reasonable doubt. There's a small chance that this is actually false.
	- Example: "All living things eventually die"
		- **Inductive reasoning**: human die - animal die- plants die - therefore, all living things eventually die
		- Why not absolute? Because in the future there'll be small possibility that can make living things immortal
- Certain VS absolute certainty
- Inductive reasoning: 
	- Starts from observation
	- Example:
		- The light in my friend's house are out
		- The curtain are dawn
		- No one is answering the phone
		Therefore, my friend must be away - he is joining a club that worship darkness - he is sleeping/hiding/dead
- How to get absolute knowledge?
	- In absolute certainty, the premises must be true and logic must be valid
	- Example of absolute certainty:
		- Adding 1 to odd number result in even number; 3 is an odd number; therefore 3+1 results in an even number - **Deducing reasoning**
		- Pluto is not a planet - If you have power over the reality, NASA have the ability to decide the qualification of a planet, which Pluto was
		- If an object is gray, it is elephant; Sarah's bag is grey; Therefore, Sarah's bag is an elephant - **This statement is valid, but not true; Logic is agreeable, but the first premises isn't true as not all gray object is elephant**
		- Human dies; Animal dies; Therefore all living things eventually die - **Inductive**
- "
- Democratic is the best form of government" - How certain are you with the statement?
	- Fundamental freedom; Promise equality; Therefore, democratic is the best form of government
- "Language is embedded in culture"
	- Greetings; Padi, gabah, beras, nasi (rice); *Conclude this yourself*

- How does our culture shape what we know?
	Our culture shape what we know, because based on the culture, there could be difference in someone's perspective of life, thus giving culture a chance to affect the way a person see and learn about something they know.

- How does what we know shape the culture?
	What we know can shape our culture, because learning from past experience can suggest us to take certain actions which may became a habit. This habit spread among people and would later become a culture in that place.

- Culture and knowledge influence each other
	- Dani tribe cut their one *ruas* of the finger, usually the pinky (culture); if a child come back from studying meds, they can tell the danger of unsterile cutting (knowledge) to their tribe.
- Evidence -> facts -> types of fact
	- facts about physical nature
	- under the control of human
	- physical evidence
- evidence to be valid must be:
	- examined
	- tested
	- verified
- opinion vs believe
	- 'believe' have stronger mark on the reader than the word 'opinion.' Belief is based on evidence and argument, whereas opinion may not always do.
- theory
	- **natural science: very large set of data collected by scientist in a long time;** this is what theory in TOK means, mostly
	- colloquial english: wild guess, doesn't have much evidence
- Plato's definition of knowledge:
	- Justified True Believe (J, T, D)
		- Your believe must be justified that it's true
		- You present evidence -> facts -> then interpret it (it should be examined, verified, and tested) -> KNOWLEDGE
- Objectivity

7. Why can we say that this data is _objective_ rather than subjective?
	Because the data provided has been stated that it's based on the comparison of atmospheric samples contained in the ice cores and more recent direct measurement. There's no

5. Are some types of knowledge less open to interpretation than others?
	Yes, some types of knowledge does in fact, less open to interpretation than other.
	The range of interpretation on knowledge is the based on how disclosed or absolute a certain knowledge is. Small examples are "Theda love to eat chocolate" and "Theda never ride a plane". The former can be interpreted that Theda , whereas the latter.
	Knowledge categorized as absolute certainty are less open to interpretation than in comparison to just certainty. 
	Knowledge that's derived from a more subjective view such as for example people. 
	
	Meanwhile, knowledge that's only certainty can be interpreted in multiple ways, such as for example the meaning of a certain boat drawing. Some may interpret it as just as it is, some interpret it as their means of living, some interpret it as a way to escape from the harsh reality, some interpret is as means to see much more of the distant places in the world. Another example is the uses of knotted rope, where some interpret it as a device of self-harm while some interpret it as a tools to tie and joint things up.
	
	Now compare that to "1 + 1 = 2" or "The result of a whole odd number divided by 2 is not a whole number". The knowledge aforementioned does not have other interpretation. Even if there are, these interpretations is irrelevant to the knowledge; the knowledge doesn't care, and will still be what it is despite the differing interpretations. This means that knowledge that's absolute certainty are less open for interpretations than knowledge that's just certainty, and therefore we can say that some type of knowledge are less open to interpretation that others.
