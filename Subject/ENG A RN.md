- Group work[6] = {2, 15, 13, 9, 17, 10} // about the north vs south political cartoon
	- Objects: 
		- "They gonna ht the confederate statues with missiles"
		- North Korean missile in the background
			- Correlation with North Korean being fond of having nuclear missiles
			- This send the message that there's a threat of war and conflicts in the comic's situation to the viewer
		- Map centered around USA with black stars on the bottom of the region
			- very wide in meaning lol; but wait, there's more:
				- Represent white s
				- The statues represent Trump and Kim Jong Un: unmoving, static, rigid, unchanging, apathetic, stubborn ('hard headed')
					- Stars can be seen in the flag of USA and North Korea, thus this means that both of the are not that different - star represent brilliance and superiority, but here it is black thus it emphasize more on the side of uncaring, steel-fist power & strict freedom limiting authority & insatiable greed - this made the reader reflect & think twice about the political prominent figures, that they're not as good as what they may appear to be in the public - they doesn't act for the people, rather for themselves
				- The count of stars on the map is 13, the same as the count of stars in the confederate flag
		- Confederate battle flag
			- Its appearance representing the instability of America
			- This signify that the continuation of this conflicts will result in the America being divided and broken apart, ripped apart
		- Paper about "Stars = Confederate Statues"
		- The portrait of Donald Trump, indicating the time the cartoon was made (Now Joe Biden is the current president)
		- The face of Kim Jong Un is uncaring to the matter discussed
		- The 'Star' & 'Order Ribbon' on the officer uniform represent the same meaning with the stars, negativity - **the stars are black colored**
